    <abstract>Abstract
We test the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis, which states that hypernyms tend to occur in
a superset of contexts in which their hyponyms are found. We find that this hypothesis only
holds when it is applied to relevant dimensions. We propose a robust supervised approach that
achieves accuracies of .84 and .85 on two existing datasets and that can be interpreted as selecting
the dimensions that are relevant for distributional inclusion.</abstract>

Introduction
One of the main criticisms of distributional models has been that they fail to distinguish between semantic
relations: Typical nearest neighbors of dog are words like cat, animal, puppy, tail, or owner, all obviously
related to dog, but through very different types of semantic relations. On these grounds, Murphy (2002)
argues that distributional models cannot be a valid model of conceptual representation. Distinguishing
semantic relations are also crucial for drawing inferences from distributional data, as different semantic
relations lead to different inference rules (Lenci, 2008). This is of practical import for tasks such as
Recognizing Textual Entailment or RTE (Geffet and Dagan, 2004).
For these reasons, research has in recent years started to attempt the detection of specific semantic
relationships, and current results suggest that distributional models can, in fact, distinguish between
semantic relations, given the right similarity measures (Weeds et al., 2004; Kotlerman et al., 2010; Lenci
and Benotto, 2012; Herbelot and Ganesalingam, 2013; Santus, 2013). Because of its relevance for RTE
and other tasks, much of this work has focused on hypernymy. Hypernymy is the semantic relation
between a superordinate term in a taxonomy (e.g. animal) and a subordinate term (e.g. dog).
Distributional approaches to date for detecting hypernymy, and the related but broader relation of
lexical entailment, have been unsupervised (except for Baroni et al. (2012)) and have mostly been based
on the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis (Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Dagan, 2005; Zhitomirsky-Geffet
and Dagan, 2009), which states that more specific terms appear in a subset of the distributional contexts
in which more general terms appear. So, animal can occur in all the contexts in which dog can occur,
plus some contexts in which dog cannot – for instance, rights can be a typical cooccurrence for animal
(e.g. “animal rights”), but not so much for dog (e.g. #“dog rights”).
This paper takes a closer look at the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis for hypernymy detection. We
show that the current best unsupervised approach is brittle in that their performance depends on the space
they are applied to. This raises the question of whether the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis is correct,
and if so, under what circumstances it holds. We use a simple supervised approach to relation detection
that has good performance (accuracy .84 on BLESS, .85 on the lexical entailment dataset of Baroni et
al. (2012)) and works well across different spaces.1 Furthermore, we show that it can be interpreted
as selecting dimensions for which the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis does hold. So, our answer is
to propose the Selective Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis: The Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis
holds, but only for relevant dimensions.

Table 2 shows the performance of the two classifiers, Concat and Diff, on both the BLESS and ENTAIL- MENT datasets, using three underlying spaces. We use the reduced versions of the three spaces, indicated by the subscript 300. Note that the Concat classifier could not converge using features from TypeDM300, so we omit the result. With both methods, we obtain a high accuracy on the two datasets, with results around .8 against baselines around .5. Our best result is .84 on BLESS and .85 on ENTAILMENT. More- over, both approaches are in general robust to changes in space parameters (with TypeDM/Concat an outlier). Still, the U+W2300 space seems to be the best for this task: Its scores are significantly6 higher than the rest, except for TypeDM on ENTAILMENT, which achieves the same score as U+W2300. Diff achieves significantly higher results than Concat.
When provided more information, Concat outperforms Diff. For instance, if cross-validation is done over all pairs in BLESS in the U+W2300 space, Concat achieves .98 accuracy, while Diff obtains .90. However, in this setting the same words appear in the training and test sets (albeit in different pairs). We take this to mean that Concat is memorizing, rather than learning the hypernymy relation. This emphasizes the need for our stricter evaluation that prevents repetition between training and test sets.
Clearly, both classifiers do fairly well at predicting hypernymy relations between words, regardless of space. Naturally, one should ask what are the classifiers capturing that the unsupervised measures are missing? We propose that the supervised classifiers perform essentially the same operation as the unsupervised measures, but are learning to determine the relevance of dimensions. In particular, Diff is learning weights on vector difference features. This is equivalent to doing selective distributional inclusion. In the next section, we test this Selective Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis.

Conclusion
In this paper, we have tested the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis, the basis for distributional ap-
proaches to hypernymy. We have found that the hypothesis only works if inclusion is selectively applied
to a set of relevant dimensions.
We have tested two simple supervised approaches to distributional hypernymy detection and have
found that they show good performance, and are robust to changes in the underlying space. Our best
classifier achieves .84 accuracy on BLESS and .85 on the ENTAILMENT dataset of Baroni et al. (2012). It
uses features that encode dimension-wise difference between vectors. This classifier can be interpreted
as selecting the dimensions necessary for the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis to work, thus as an
effective way to implement selective distributional inclusion.
The next natural step is to use the supervised features to guide development of an unsupervised mea-
sure for hypernymy detection: Now that we have examples, we hope to propose a method which selects
relevant features automatically. We also would like to explore detection of other relationships, such
as meronymy. Finally, we would like to perform an extrinsic evaluation of our hypernymy detection
approach in an actual RTE system.
