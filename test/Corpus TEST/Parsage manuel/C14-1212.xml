    <abstract>Abstract
This work is concerned with distinguishing different semantic relations which exist between
distributionally similar words. We compare a novel approach based on training a linear Support
Vector Machine on pairs of feature vectors with state-of-the-art methods based on distributional
similarity. We show that the new supervised approach does better even when there is minimal
information about the target words in the training data, giving a 15% reduction in error rate over
unsupervised approaches.</abstract>

Introduction
Over recent years there has been much interest in the field of distributional semantics, drawing on the
distributional hypothesis: words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings (Harris,
1954). There is a large body of work on the use of different similarity measures (Lee, 1999; Weeds and
Weir, 2003; Curran, 2004) and many researchers have built thesauri (i.e. lists of “nearest neighbours”)
automatically and applied them in a variety of applications, generally with a good deal of success.
In early research there was much interest in how these automatically generated thesauri compare with
human-constructed gold standards such as WordNet and Roget (Lin, 1998; Kilgarriff and Yallop, 2000).
More recently, the focus has tended to shift to building thesauri to alleviate the sparse-data problem. Dis-
tributional thesauri have been used in a wide variety of areas including sentiment classification (Bollegala
et al., 2011), WSD (Miller et al., 2012; Khapra et al., 2010), textual entailment (Berant et al., 2010), pre-
dicting semantic compositionality (Bergsma et al., 2010), acquisition of semantic lexicons (McIntosh,
2010), conversation entailment (Zhang and Chai, 2010), lexical substitution (Szarvas et al., 2013), tax-
onomy induction (Fountain and Lapata, 2012), and parser lexicalisation (Rei and Briscoe, 2013).
A primary focus of distributional semantics has been on identifying words which are similar to each
other. However, semantic similarity encompasses a variety of different lexico-semantic and topical re-
lations. Even if we just consider nouns, an automatically generated thesaurus will tend to return a mix
of synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms, co-hyponyms, meronyms and other topically related
words. A central problem here is that whilst most measures of distributional similarity are symmetric,
some of the important semantic relations are not. The hyponymy relation (and converse hypernymy)
which forms the ISA backbone of taxonomies and ontologies such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1989), and
determines lexical entailment (Geffet and Dagan, 2005), is asymmetric. On the other hand, the co-
hyponymy relation which relates two words unrelated by hyponymy but sharing a (close) hypernym, is
symmetric, as are synonymy and antonymy. Table 1 shows the distributionally nearest neighbours of the
words cat, animal and dog. In the list for cat we can see 2 hypernyms and 13 co-hyponyms1.
1We read cat in the sense domestic cat rather than big cat, hence tiger is a co-hyponym rather than hyponym
of cat.

1998) considering all words and dependency features occurring 100 or more times in Wikipedia.
Distributional similarity is being deployed (e.g., Dinu and Thater (2012)) in situations where it can
be useful to be able to distinguish between these different relationships. Consider the following two
sentences.
The cat ran across the road.
(1)
The animal ran across the road.
(2)
Sentence 1 textually entails sentence 2, but sentence 2 does not textually entail sentence 1. The ability
to determine whether entailment holds between the sentences, and in which direction, depends on the
ability to identify hyponymy. Given a similarity score of 0.29 between cat and animal, how do we
know which is the hyponym and which is the hypernym?
In applying distributional semantics to the problem of textual entailment, there is a need to generalise
lexical entailment to phrases and sentences. Thus, the ability to distinguish different semantic relations
is crucial if approaches to the composition of distributional representations of meaning that are currently
receiving considerable interest (Widdows, 2008; Mitchell and Lapata, 2008; Baroni and Zamparelli,
2010; Grefenstette et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2012; Weeds et al., 2014) are to be applied to the textual
entailment problem.
We formulate the challenge as follows: Consider a set of pairs of similar words ⟨ A, B
⟩ where one of
three relationships hold between A and B
: A lexically entails B
, B
lexically entails A or A and B
are
related by co-hyponymy. Given such a set, how can we determine which relationship holds? In Section
2, we discuss existing attempts to address this problem through the use of various directional measures
of distributional similarity.
This paper considers the effectiveness of various supervised approaches, and makes the following
contributions. First, we show that a SVM can distinguish the entailment and co-hyponymy relations,
achieving a significant reduction in error rate in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods based
on the notion of distributional generality. Second, by comparing two different data sets, one built from
BLESS (Baroni and Lenci, 2011) and the other from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1989), we derive important
insights into the requirements of a valid evaluation of supervised approaches, and provide a data set
for further research in this area. Third, we show that when learning how to determine an ontological
relationship between a pair of similar words by means of the word’s distributional vectors, quite different
vector operations are useful when identifying different ontological relationships. In particular, using the
difference between the vectors for pairs of words is appropriate for the entailment task, whereas adding
the vectors works well for the co-hyponym task.</introduction>
    <results>4 Results
In Table 3, we compare average accuracy for a number of different classifiers on each of two tasks, distinguishing hyponyms and distinguishing co-hyponyms, on each of the two datasets.
Looking at the results for the hyponymBLESS data set, we can see that the SVM methods do generally outperform the unsupervised methods. However, the best performing model is svmSING, suggesting that, for this data set, it is best to try to learn the distributional features of more general terms, rather than comparing the vector representations of the two terms under consideration.
6Note that imposing these requirements on the BLESS data sets would lead to very small data sets, since information is only provided for 200 nouns.

 Table 3: Accuracy Figures for the data sets generated from BLESS and WordNet (standard errors &lt; 0.02). For cohyponyms, results for measures designed to detect hyponymy have been omitted. We also omit results of clarkediff as these were consistently the same or less than CRdiff.
On the corresponding co-hyponym task, using the cohyponymBLESS data set, we see the best performing classifier is the cosine measure. The cosine measure is able to perform relatively well here because a substantial proportion of the negative examples (25%) are random unrelated words which will have low cosine scores. It is also consistent with earlier work (e.g., (Lenci and Benotto, 2012)) which suggests that measures such as the cosine measure “prefer” words in symmetric semantic relationships such as co- hyponymy. The poor performance of the SVM methods here can perhaps be explained by the paucity of the training data in this experimental set up with this data set. If, for example, our test concept is robin, our approach requires that we will not have any training pairs containing robin, or any training pairs containing any of the words to which robin is related in the test set. In a dataset as small as BLESS, this requirement effectively removes all knowledge of the distributional features of words in the target domain. Hence, the need for a larger dataset as we have extracted from WordNet.
Looking at the results for the hyponymWN data set, the directional SVM methods (svmDIFF and svm- CAT) substantially outperform the symmetric SVM methods, and their performance is significantly better (at the 0.01% level) than the unsupervised methods. Also of note is the substantial difference between svmDIFF and knnDIFF. Both of these methods are trained on the differences of vectors. However, the linear SVM outperforms kNN by 19–25%. This may suggest that the shape of the vector space inhabited by the positive entailment pairs is particularly conducive for learning a linear SVM. Positive and negative pairs are close together (as evidenced by the poor performance of kNN), but generally linearly separable.
Looking at the results for the cohyponymWN data set, it is clear that the unsupervised methods cannot distinguish the co-hyponym pairs from the entailing pairs. The supervised SVM methods do substantially better, with the best performance achieved by svmADD and svmCAT. Both of these methods essentially retain information about all of the features of both words. svmMULT does much better than svmDIFF, which suggests that the shared features are more indicative than the non-shared features for this task.
The reasonably high performance of svmSING on both data sets suggests that words which have co- hyponyms in the data set tend to inhabit a somewhat different part of the feature space to words which are included as entailed words in the data set. We hypothesise that there are specific features which more general words tend to share (regardless of their topic) which makes it possible to identify more general words from more specific words. This is completely consistent with very recent results using SLQS, a new entropy-based measure (Santus et al., 2014). Here, the authors hypothesise that the most typical contexts of a hypernym are less informative than the most typical linguistic contexts of its hyponyms, with some promising results. It would be plausible to hypothesise that svmSING is learning which nouns typically have less informative contexts and are therefore likely to by hypernyms.
Given prior work, the performance of the balAPincP measure is lower than expected on the hyponymWN dataset. Our task is slightly different to that of (Kotlerman et al., 2010), since we are deter- mining the existence (or not) of hyponymy, rather than the direction of entailment for pairs where it is known that a relationship exists. It could be that the measure is particularly suited to the latter task.

Conclusions and Further Work
We have shown that it is possible to predict to a large extent whether or not there is a specific semantic
relation between two words given their distributional vectors, using a supervised approach based on
linear SVMs. The increase in accuracy over unsupervised methods is significant at the 0.01% level and
corresponds to a substantial absolute reduction in error rate (over 15%).
We have also shown that the choice of vector operation is significant. Whilst concatenating the vectors,
and therefore retaining all of the information from both vectors including direction, generally performs
well, we have also shown that different vector operations are useful in establishing different relationships.
In particular, the vector difference operation, which loses information about the original vectors, achieved
performance indistinguishable from concatenation on the entailment task, where the classifier is required
to distinguish hyponyms from other semantically related words including hypernyms. On the other
hand, the addition operation, which also loses information, outperformed concatenation by 4% (which
is statistically significant at the 0.01% level) on the coordinate task, where the classifier is required to
distinguish co-hyponyms from hyponyms and hypernyms. Hence the nature of the relationship one is
trying to establish between words determines the nature of the operation one should perform on their
associated vectors.
We have also shown that it is possible to outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised methods even when
a data set has been constructed without ontological information, and when target words have not previ-
ously been seen in that position of a relationship in the training data. Hence, we believe the supervised
methods are learning characteristics of the underlying feature space which are generalisable to new words
(inhabiting the same feature space).
In future work, we intend to apply this approach to the problem of labelling the distributional neigh-
bours found for a given word with specific semantic relations. We also plan to investigate the use of
bag-of-words (windowed) vectors instead of grammatical relations for this task.
Finally, we believe that the data sets constructed from WordNet, which we publish alongside this
paper, can be used as a useful benchmark in evaluating future advances in this area, both for supervised
and unsupervised methods.
