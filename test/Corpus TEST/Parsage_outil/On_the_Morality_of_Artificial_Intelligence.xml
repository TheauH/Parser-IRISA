4    Conclusion
Technology in general, and ML more specifically, carries a great potential for change and disruption. While
neither of these is guaranteed to make the world a better place, this potential can most definitely be used
to have a positive impact on the world. In the present article, we have illustrated some inspiring projects
that aim to make the world a better place and by using the powerful techniques and approaches that ML has
brought forward. We believe that as ML researchers and practitioners, we have the responsibility to leverage
our (super)powers to contribute to these efforts. This can be done by connecting with established actors from
industry and policy or experts from other relevant disciplines, by learning from their past experiences, and
by working together to propose innovative solutions to major problems, deployed in places where they will
have a positive impact.
     We live in a world with many global and local challenges and issues that are in constant evolution, and
it is easy to be overwhelmed by this flux of information and focus on a small sandbox in which we feel
safe and in control, in order to develop and study the aspects of ML that interest us most. But it is naive


to believe that our sandbox is an isolated isle that is not connected to the rest of the world – since even in
the case of theoretical work, communication and cross-pollination are unavoidable – and each of us is also
a citizen who is concerned collective debates, while many of us could worry about the world in which our
descendants will live. We believe that there are thought processes that should take place in the head of every
ML practitioner regarding the nature of the work they are doing and the potential pitfalls and impacts of
this work in the world around them, some of which we have listed in the first part of the current paper. And
while we do not claim to have all the answers to all of these tough questions, we hope that we can start a
conversation that will accompany ML research and practice throughout its infancy towards its tumultuous
teenage years in the coming decades, and eventually towards mature adulthood beyond that.
