This article presents a new incremental learning algorithm for classification tasks, called NetLines, which is well adapted for both binary
and real-valued input patterns. It generates small, compact feedforward
neural networks with one hidden layer of binary units and binary output
units. A convergence theorem ensures that solutions with a finite number of hidden units exist for both binary and real-valued input patterns.
An implementation for problems with more than two classes, valid
for any binary classifier, is proposed. The generalization error and
the size of the resulting networks are compared to the best published
results on well-known classification benchmarks. Early stopping is shown
to decrease overfitting, without improving the generalization performance.

1 Introduction
Feedforward neural networks have been successfully applied to the problem of learning pattern classification from examples. The relationship of the
number of weights to the learning capacity and the network’s generalization
ability is well understood only for the simple perceptron, a single binary
unit whose output is a sigmoidal function of the weighted sum of its inputs.
In this case, efficient learning algorithms based on theoretical results allow
the determination of the optimal weights. However, simple perceptrons can
generalize only those (very few) problems in which the input patterns are
linearly separable (LS). In many actual classification tasks, multilayered perceptrons with hidden units are needed. However, neither the architecture
(number of units, number of layers) nor the functions that hidden units
have to learn are known a priori, and the theoretical understanding of these
networks is not enough to provide useful hints.
Although pattern classification is an intrinsically discrete task, it may be
cast as a problem of function approximation or regression by assigning real
values to the targets. This is the approach used by backpropagation and

related algorithms, which minimize the squared training error of the output units. The approximating function must be highly nonlinear because it
has to fit a constant value inside the domains of each class and present a
large variation at the boundaries between classes. For example, in a binary
classification task in which the two classes are coded as +1 and −1, the
approximating function must be constant and positive in the input space
regions or domains corresponding to class 1 and constant and negative
for those of class −1. The network’s weights are trained to fit this function
everywhere—in particular, inside the class domains—instead of concentrating on the relevant problem of the determination of the frontiers between
classes. Because the number of parameters needed for the fit is not known
a priori, it is tempting to train a large number of weights that can span, at
least in principle, a large set of functions expected to contain the “true” one.
This introduces a small bias (Geman, Bienenstock, & Doursat, 1992), but
leaves us with the difficult problem of minimizing a cost function in a highdimensional space, with the risk that the algorithm gets stuck in spurious
local minima, whose number grows with the number of weights. In practice, the best generalizer is determined through a trial-and-error process in
which both the numbers of neurons and weights are varied.
An alternative approach is provided by incremental, adaptive, or growth
algorithms, in which the hidden units are successively added to the network.
One advantage is fast learning, not only because the problem is reduced to
training simple perceptrons but also because adaptive procedures do not
need the trial-and-error search for the most convenient architecture. Growth
algorithms allow the use of binary hidden neurons, well suited for building
hardware-dedicated devices. Each binary unit determines a domain boundary in input space. Patterns lying on either side of the boundary are given
different hidden states. Thus, all the patterns inside a domain in input space
are mapped to the same internal representation (IR). This binary encoding is
different for each domain. The output unit performs a logic (binary) function
of these IRs, a feature that may be useful for rule extraction. Because there
is not a unique way of associating IRs to the input patterns, different incremental learning algorithms propose different targets to be learned by the
appended hidden neurons. This is not the only difference. Several heuristics
exist that generate fully connected feedforward networks with one or more
layers, and treelike architectures with different types of neurons (linear, radial basis functions). Most of these algorithms are not optimal with respect
to the number of weights or hidden units. Indeed, growth algorithms have
often been criticized because they may generate networks that are too large,
generally believed to be poor generalizers because of overfitting.
This article presents a new incremental learning algorithm for binary
classification tasks that generates small feedforward networks. These networks have a single hidden layer of binary neurons fully connected to the
inputs and a single output neuron connected to the hidden units. We call
it NetLines, for Neural Encoder Through Linear Separations. During the

Classification Tasks with Binary Units

learning process, the targets that each appended hidden unit has to learn
help to decrease the number of classification errors of the output neuron.
The crucial test for any learning algorithm is the generalization ability of
the resulting network. It turns out that the networks built with NetLines are
generally smaller and generalize better than the best networks found so far
on well-known benchmarks. Thus, large networks do not necessarily follow from growth heuristics. On the other hand, although smaller networks
may be generated with NetLines through early stopping, we found that
they do not generalize better than the networks that were trained until the
number of training errors vanished. Thus, overfitting does not necessarily
spoil the network’s performance. This surprising result is in good agreement
with recent work on the bias-variance dilemma (Friedman, 1996) showing
that, unlike in regression problems where bias and variance compete in the
determination of the optimal generalizer, in the case of classification they
combine in a highly nonlinear way.
Although NetLines creates networks for two-class problems, multiclass
problems may be solved using any strategy that combines binary classifiers,
like winner-takes-all. We propose a more involved approach, through the
construction of a tree of networks, that may be coupled with any binary
classifier.
NetLines is an efficient approach for creating small, compact classifiers
for problems with binary or continuous inputs. It is best suited for problems
requiring a discrete classification decision. Although it may estimate posterior probabilities, as discussed in section 2.6, this requires more information
than the bare network’s output. Another weakness of NetLines is that it is
not simple to retrain the network when new patterns are available or class
priors change over time.
In section 2, we give the basic definitions and present a simple example
of our strategy, followed by the formal presentation of the growth heuristics
and the perceptron learning algorithm used to train the individual units.
In section 3 we compare NetLines to other growth strategies. The construction of trees of networks for multiclass problems is presented in section 4.
A comparison of the generalization error and the network’s size, with results obtained with other learning procedures, is presented in section 5. The
conclusions are set out in section 6.

{ξE µ , τ µ }, where µ = 1, 2, . . . , P. The inputs ξE µ = (1, ξ1 , ξ2 , . . . , ξN ) may be

binary or real valued N+1 dimensional vectors. The first component ξ0 ≡ 1,
the same for all the patterns, allows us to treat the bias as a supplementary
weight. The outputs are binary, τ µ = ±1. These patterns are used to learn
the classification task with the growth algorithm. Assume that, at a given
stage of the learning process, the network already has h binary neurons

in the hidden layer. These neurons are connected to the N + 1 input units

σE (h) = (1, σ1 , . . . , σh ) is the h-dimensional IR associated by the network
of h hidden units to pattern ξE µ . During the training process, h increases
through the addition of hidden neurons, and we denote the final number
of hidden units as H.
2.2 Example. We first describe the general strategy on a schematic example (see Figure 1). Patterns in the gray region belong to class τ = +1, the
others to τ = −1. The algorithm proceeds as follows. A first hidden unit
is trained to separate the input patterns at best and finds one solution, say
E 1 , represented on Figure 1 by the line labeled 1, with the arrow pointing
w
into the positive half-space. Because training errors remain, a second hidden neuron is introduced. It is trained to learn targets τ2 = +1 for patterns
well classified by the first neuron and τ2 = −1 for the others (the opposite
convention could be adopted, both being strictly equivalent), and suppose
E 2 is found. Then an output unit is connected to the two hidthat solution w
den neurons and is trained with the original targets. Clearly it will fail to
separate all the patterns correctly because the IR (−1, 1) and (+−) are not
faithful, as patterns of both classes are mapped onto them. The output neuron is dropped, and a third hidden unit is appended and trained with targets
τ3 = +1 for patterns that were correctly classified by the output neuron and
E 3 is found, and it is easy to see that now
τ3 = −1 for the others. Solution w
the IRs are faithful, that is, patterns belonging to different classes are given
different IRs. The algorithm converged with three hidden units that define
three domain boundaries determining six regions or domains in the input
space. It is straightforward to verify that the IRs corresponding to each domain on Figure 1 are linearly separable. Thus, the output unit will find the
correct solution to the training problem. If the faithful IRs were not linearly
separable, the output unit would not find a solution without training errors,
and the algorithm would go on appending hidden units that should learn

targets τ = 1 for well-learned patterns, and τ = −1 for the others. A proof
that a solution to this strategy with a finite number of hidden units exists is
left to the appendix.
2.3 The Algorithm NetLines. Like most other adaptive learning algorithms, NetLines combines a growth heuristics with a particular learning
algorithm for training the individual units, which are simple perceptrons.
In this section, we present the growth heuristics first, followed by the description of Minimerror, our perceptron learning algorithm.
We first introduce the following useful remark: if a neuron has to learn a
target τ , and the learned state turns out to be σ , then the product σ τ = 1 if
the target has been correctly learned, and σ τ = −1 otherwise.
Given a maximal accepted number of hidden units, Hmax , and a maximal
number of tolerated training errors, Emax , the Netlines algorithm may be
summarized as follows:

The generated network has H = h hidden units. In the appendix we present
a solution to the learning strategy with a bounded number of hidden units.
In practice, the algorithm ends up with much smaller networks than this
upper bound, as will be shown in section 5.
2.4 The Perceptron Learning Algorithm. The final number of hidden
neurons, which are simple perceptrons, depends on the performance of the
learning algorithm used to train them. The best solution should minimize
the number of errors. If the training set is LS, it should endow the units with
the lowest generalization error. Our incremental algorithm uses Minimerror
(Gordon & Berchier, 1993) to train the hidden and output units. Minimerror is based on the minimization of a cost function E that depends on the
E through the stabilities of the training patterns. If the
perceptron weights w
input vector is ξE µ and τ µ the corresponding target, then the stability γ µ of
pattern µ is a continuous and derivable function of the weights, given by:

otherwise. The cost function E is:

(2.4)

The contribution to E of patterns with large negative stabilities is ' 1, that
is, they are counted as errors, whereas the contribution of patterns with
large, positive stabilities is vanishingly small. Patterns at both sides of the
hyperplane within a window of width ≈ 4T contribute to the cost function
even if they have positive stability.
The properties of the global minimum of equation 2.4 have been studied
theoretically with methods of statistical mechanics (Gordon & Grempel,
1995). It was shown that in the limit T → 0, the minimum of E corresponds
to the weights that minimize the number of training errors. If the training
set is LS, these weights are not unique (Gyorgyi & Tishby, 1990). In that case,
there is an optimal learning temperature such that the weights minimizing
E at that temperature endow the perceptron with a generalization error
numerically indistinguishable from the optimal (Bayesian) value.
The algorithm Minimerror (Gordon & Berchier, 1993; Raffin & Gordon,
1995) implements a minimization of E restricted to a subspace of normalized
weights, through a gradient descent combined with a slow decrease of the
temperature T, which is equivalent to a deterministic annealing. It has been
shown that the convergence is faster if patterns with negative stabilities are
considered at a temperature T− larger than those with positive stabilities,
T+ , with a constant ratio θ = T− /T+ . The weights and the temperatures are
iteratively updated through:

Notice from equation 2.5 that only the incorrectly learned patterns at distances shorter than ≈ 2T− from the hyperplane, and those correctly learned
lying closer than ≈ 2T+ , contribute effectively to learning. The contribution of patterns outside this region is vanishingly small. By decreasing the
temperature, the algorithm selects to learn patterns increasingly localized
in the neighborhood of the hyperplane, allowing for a highly precise determination of the parameters defining the hyperplane, which are the neuron’s weights.

they should be adapted to each√specific problem. However, as a result of
our normalizing the weights to N + 1 and to data standardization (see the
next section), all the problems are brought to the same scale, simplifying the
choice of the parameters.
2.5 Data Standardization. Instead of determining the best parameters
for each new problem, we standardize the input patterns of the training set
through a linear transformation, applied to each component:

so that the normalization (see equation 2.8) is completely transparent to the
user: with the transformed weights (see equations 2.11 and 2.12), the neural
classifier is applied to the data in the original user’s units, which do not
need to be renormalized.
As a consequence of the weights scaling (see equation 2.7) and the inputs standardization (see equation 2.8), all the problems are automatically
rescaled. This allows us to use always the same values of Minimerror’s parameters: the standard values ² = 0.02, δT−1 = 10−3 , and θ = 6. They were
used throughout this article, the reported results being highly insensitive to
slight variations of them. However, in some extremely difficult cases, like
learning the parity in dimensions N > 10 and finding the separation of the
sonar signals (see section 5), larger values of θ were needed.

2.6 Interpretation. It has been shown (Gordon, Peretto, & Berchier, 1993)
that the contribution of each pattern to the cost function of Minimerror,
[1 − tanh(γ µ /2T)]/2, may be interpreted as the probability of misclassification at the temperature T at which the minimum of the cost function has
been determined. By analogy, the neuron’s prediction on a new input ξE may
be given a confidence measure by replacing the (unknown) pattern stabilE · ξE k/kwk,
E which is its distance to the
ity by its absolute value kγ k = kw
hyperplane. This interpretation of the sigmoidal function tanh(kγ k/2T) as
the confidence on the neuron’s output is similar to the one proposed earlier
(Goodman, Smyth, Higgins, & Miller, 1992) within an approach based on
information theory.
The generalization of these ideas to multilayered networks is not straightforward. An estimate of the confidence on the classification by the output
neuron should include the magnitude of the weighted sums of the hidden
neurons, as they measure the distances of the input pattern to the domain
boundaries. However, short distances to the separating hyperplanes are not
always correlated to low confidence on the network’s output. For an example, we refer again to Figure 1. Consider a pattern lying close to hyperplane
1. A small, weighted sum on neuron 1 may cast doubt on the classification
if the pattern’s IR is (− + +) but not if it is (− + −), because a change of the
sign of the weighted sum in the latter case will map the pattern to the IR
(+ + −) which, being another IR of the same class, will be given the same
output by the network. It is worth noting that the same difficulty is met by
the interpretation of the outputs of multilayered perceptrons, trained with
backpropagation, as posterior probabilities. We do not explore this problem
any further because it is beyond the scope of this article.
3 Comparison with Other Strategies
There are few learning algorithms for neural networks composed of binary
units. To our knowledge, all of them are incremental. In this section, we
give a short overview of some of them, in order to put forward the main
differences with NetLines. We discuss the growth heuristics and then the
individual unit training algorithms.
The Tiling algorithm (Mézard & Nadal, 1989) introduces hidden layers,
one after the other. The first neuron of each layer is trained to learn an IR that
helps to decrease the number of training errors; supplementary hidden units
are then appended to the layer until the IRs of all the patterns in the training set are faithful. This procedure may generate very large networks. The
Upstart algorithm (Frean, 1990) introduces successive couples of daughter
hidden units between the input layer and the previously included hidden
units, which become their parents. The daughters are trained to correct
the parents’ classification errors, one daughter for each class. The obtained
network has a treelike architecture. There are two different algorithms implementing the Tilinglike Learning in the Parity Machine (Biehl & Opper,

1016

J. Manuel Torres Moreno and Mirta B. Gordon

1991), Offset (Martinez & Estève, 1992), and MonoPlane (Torres Moreno &
Gordon, 1995). In both, each appended unit is trained to correct the errors
of the previously included unit in the same hidden layer, a procedure that
has been shown to generate a parity machine: the class of the input patterns
is the parity of the learned IRs. Unlike Offset, which implements the parity
through a second hidden layer that needs to be pruned, MonoPlane goes
on adding hidden units (if necessary) in the same hidden layer until the
number of training errors at the output vanishes. Convergence proofs for
binary input patterns have been produced for all these algorithms. In the
case of real-valued input patterns, a solution to the parity machine with a
bounded number of hidden units also exists (Gordon, 1996).
The rationale behind the construction of the parity machine is that it
is not worth training the output unit before all the training errors of the
hidden units have been corrected. However, Marchand, Golea, and Ruján
(1990) pointed out that it is not necessary to correct all the errors of the
successively trained hidden units. It is sufficient that the IRs be faithful and
LS. If the output unit is trained immediately after each appended hidden
unit, the network may discover that the IRs are already faithful and stop
adding units. This may be seen in Figure 1. None of the parity machine
implementations would find the solution represented on the figure, because
each of the three perceptrons systematically unlearns part of the patterns
learned by the preceding one.
To our knowledge, Sequential Learning (Marchand et al., 1990) is the
only incremental learning algorithm that might find a solution equivalent
(although not the same) to the one of Figure 1. In this algorithm, the first
unit is trained to separate the training set keeping one “pure” half-space—
containing patterns of only one class. Wrongly classified patterns, if any,
must all lie in the other half-space. Each appended neuron is trained to
separate wrongly classified patterns with this constraint of always keeping
one pure, error-free half-space. Thus, neurons must be appended in a precise
order, making the algorithm difficult to implement in practice. For example,
Sequential Learning applied to the problem of Figure 1 needs to impose that
E 3 , the only solution satisfying the purity
the first unit finds the weights w
restriction.
Other proposed incremental learning algorithms strive to solve the problem with different architectures, and/or with real valued units. For example,
in the algorithm Cascade Correlation (Fahlman & Lebiere, 1990), each appended unit is selected among a pool of several real-valued neurons, trained
to learn the correlation between the targets and the training errors. The unit
is then connected to the input units and to all the other hidden neurons
already included in the network.
Another approach to learning classification tasks is through the construction of decision trees (Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, & Stone, 1984), which hierarchically partition the input space through successive dichotomies. The
neural networks implementations generate treelike architectures. Each neu-

Classification Tasks with Binary Units

1017

ron of the tree introduces a dichotomy of the input space, which is treated
separately by the children nodes, which eventually produce new splits. Besides the weights, the resulting networks need to store the decision path.
The proposed heuristics (Sirat & Nadal, 1990; Farrell & Mammone, 1994;
Knerr, Personnaz, & Dreyfus, 1990) differ in the algorithm used to train each
node and/or in the stopping criterion. In particular, Neural-Trees (Sirat &
Nadal, 1990) may be regarded as a generalization of Classification and Regression Trees (CART) (Breiman et al., 1984) in which the hyperplanes are
not constrained to be perpendicular to the coordinate axis. The heuristics of
the Modified Neural Tree Network (MNTN) (Farrell & Mammone, 1994),
similar to Neural-Trees, includes a criterion of early stopping based on a
confidence measure of the partition. As NetLines considers the whole input
space to train each hidden unit, it generates domain boundaries that may
greatly differ from the splits produced by trees. We are not aware of any
systematic study or theoretical comparison of both approaches.
Other algorithms, like Restricted Coulomb Energy (RCE) (Reilly, Cooper,
& Elbaum, 1982), Grow and Learn (GAL) (Alpaydin, 1990), Glocal (Depenau, 1995), and Growing Cells (Fritzke, 1994), propose to cover or mask the
input space with hyperspheres of adaptive size containing patterns of the
same class. These approaches generally end up with a very large number of
units. Covering Regions by the LP Method (Mukhopadhyay, Roy, Kim, &
Govil, 1993) is a trial-and-error procedure devised to select the most efficient
masks among hyperplanes, hyperspheres, and hyperellipsoids. The mask’s
parameters are determined through linear programming.
Many incremental strategies use the Pocket algorithm (Gallant, 1986)
to train the appended units. Its main drawback is that it has no natural
stopping condition, which is left to the user’s patience. The proposed alternative algorithms (Frean, 1992; Bottou & Vapnik, 1992) are not guaranteed
to find the best solution to the problem of learning. The algorithm used by
the MNTN (Farrell & Mammone, 1994) and the ITRULE (Goodman et al.,
1992) minimize cost functions similar to equation 2.4, but using different
misclassification measures at the place of our stability (see equation 2.3).
The essential difference with Minimerror is that none of these algorithms is
able to control which patterns contribute to learning, as Minimerror does
with the temperature.
4 Generalization to Multiclass Problems
The usual way to cope with problems having more than two classes is to
generate as many networks as classes. Each network is trained to separate
patterns of one class from all the others, and a winner-takes-all (WTA) strategy based on the value of the output’s weighted sum in equation 2.2 is used
to decide the class if more than one network recognizes the input pattern. In
our case, because we use normalized weights, the output’s weighted sum
is merely the distance of the IR to the separating hyperplane. All the pat-

1018

J. Manuel Torres Moreno and Mirta B. Gordon

terns mapped to the same IR are given the same output’s weighted sum,
independent of the relative position of the pattern in input space. A strong
weighted sum on the output neuron is not inconsistent with small weighted
sums on the hidden neurons. Therefore, a naive WTA decision may not give
good results, as shown in the example in section 5.3.1.
We now describe an implementation for the multiclass problem that results in a treelike architecture of networks. It is more involved than the naive
WTA and may be applied to any binary classifier. Suppose that we have a
problem with C classes. We must choose in which order the classes will
be learned, say (c1 , c2 , . . . , cC ). This order constitutes a particular learning
sequence. Given a particular learning sequence, a first network is trained
to separate class c1 , which is given output target τ1 = +1, from the others
(which are given targets τ1 = −1). The opposite convention is equivalent
and could equally be used. After training, all the patterns of class c1 are
eliminated from the training set, and we generate a second network trained
to separate patterns of class c2 from the remaining classes. The procedure,
reiterated with training sets of decreasing size, generates C − 1 hierarchically organized tree of networks (TON): the outputs are ordered sequences
ζE = (ζ1 , ζ2 , . . . , ζC−1 ). The predicted class of a pattern is ci , where i is the
first network in the sequence having an output +1 (ζi = +1 and ζj = −1 for
j < i), the outputs of the networks with j > i being irrelevant.
The performance of the TON may depend on the chosen learning sequence. Therefore, it is convenient that an odd number of TONs, trained
with different learning sequences, compete through a vote. We verified empirically, as is shown in section 5.3, that this vote improves the results obtained with each of the individual TONs participating in the vote. Notice
that our procedure is different from bagging (Breiman, 1994); all the networks of the TON are trained with the same training set, without the need
of any resampling procedure.
5 Applications
Although convergence proofs of learning algorithms are satisfactory on theoretical grounds, they are not a guarantee of good generalization. In fact,
they demonstrate only that correct learning is possible; they do not address
the problem of generalization. This last issue still remains quite empirical
(Vapnik, 1992; Geman et al., 1992; Friedman, 1996), and the generalization
performance of learning algorithms is usually tested on well-known benchmarks (Prechelt, 1994).
We first tested the algorithm on learning the parity function of N bits for
2 ≤ N ≤ 11. It is well known that the smallest network with the architecture
considered here needs H = N hidden neurons. The optimal architecture
was found in all the cases. Although this is quite an unusual performance,
the parity is not a representative problem: learning is exhaustive, and generalization cannot be tested. Another test, the classification of sonar signals

Classification Tasks with Binary Units

1019

(Gorman & Sejnowski, 1988), revealed the quality of Minimerror, as it solved
the problem without hidden units. In fact, we found that not only the training set of this benchmark is linearly separable, a result already reported
(Hoehfeld & Fahlman, 1991; Roy, Kim, & Mukhopadhyay, 1993), but that
the complete database—the training and the test sets together—is also linearly separable (Torres Moreno & Gordon, 1998).
We next present our results, generalization error ²g and number of weights,
on several benchmarks corresponding to different kinds of problems: binary
classification of binary input patterns, binary classification of real-valued
input patterns, and multiclass problems. These benchmarks were chosen
because they have already served as a test for many other algorithms, providing us with unbiased results for comparison. The generalization error
²g of NetLines was estimated as usual, through the fraction of misclassified
patterns on a test set of data.
The results are reported as a function of the training sets sizes P whenever
these sizes are not specified by the benchmark. Besides the generalization
error ²g , averaged over a (specified) number of classifiers trained with randomly selected training sets, we also present the number of weights of the
corresponding networks which is a measure of the classifier’s complexity,
as it corresponds to the number of its parameters.
Training times are usually cited among the characteristics of the training
algorithms. Only the numbers of epochs used by backpropagation on two
of the studied benchmarks have been published; we restrict the comparison
to these cases. As NetLines updates only N weights per epoch, whereas
backpropagation updates all the network’s weights, we compare the total
number of weights updates. They are of the same order of magnitude for
both algorithms. However, these comparisons should be taken with caution. NetLines is a deterministic algorithm; it learns the architecture and
the weights through a single run, whereas with backpropagation several
architectures must be previously investigated, and this time is not included
in the training time.
The following notation is used: D is the total number of available patterns,
P the number of training patterns, and G the number of test patterns.
5.1 Binary Inputs. The case of binary input patterns has the property,
not shared by real-valued inputs, that every pattern may be separated from
the others by a single hyperplane. This solution, usually called grandmother,
needs as many hidden units as patterns in the training set. In fact, the convergence proofs for incremental algorithms in the case of binary input patterns
are based on this property.
5.1.1 Monk’s Problem. This benchmark, thoroughly studied with many
different learning algorithms (Trhun et al., 1991), contains three distinct
problems. Each has an underlying logical proposition that depends on six
discrete variables, coded with N = 17 binary numbers. The total number of

1020

J. Manuel Torres Moreno and Mirta B. Gordon

possible input patterns is D = 432, and the targets correspond to the truth table of the corresponding proposition. Both NetLines and MonoPlane found
the underlying logical proposition of the first two problems; they generalized correctly, giving ²g = 0. In fact, these are easy problems: all the neural
network–based algorithms, and some nonneural learning algorithms were
reported to generalize them correctly. In the third Monk’s problem, 6 patterns among the P3 = 122 examples are given wrong targets. The generalization error is calculated over the complete set of D = 432 patterns, that is,
including the training patterns, but in the test set all the patterns are given
the correct targets. Thus, any training method that learns the training set
correctly will make at least 1.4% of generalization errors. Four algorithms
specially adapted to noisy problems were reported to reach ²g = 0. However,
none of them generalizes correctly the two other (noiseless) Monk’s problems. Besides them, the best performance, ²g = 0.0277, which corresponds
to 12 misclassified patterns, is reached only by neural networks methods:
backpropagation, backpropagation with weight decay, cascade correlation,
and NetLines. The number of hidden units generated with NetLines (58
weights) is intermediate between backpropagation with weight decay (39)
and cascade correlation (75) or backpropagation (77). MonoPlane reached a
slightly worse performance (²g = 0.0416, or 18 misclassified patterns) with
the same number of weights as NetLines, showing that the parity machine
encoding may not be optimal.
5.1.2 Two or More Clumps. In this problem (Denker et al., 1987) the network has to discriminate if the number of clumps in a ring of N bits is strictly
smaller than 2 or not. One clump is a sequence of identical bits bounded by
bits of the other kind. The patterns are generated through a Monte Carlo
method in which the mean number of clumps is controlled by a parameter
k (Mézard & Nadal, 1989). We generated training sets of P patterns with
k = 3, corresponding to a mean number of clumps of ≈ 1.5, for rings of
N = 10 and N = 25 bits. The generalization error corresponding to several learning algorithms, estimated with independently generated testing
sets of the same sizes as the training sets, G = P, are displayed in Figure 2
as a function of P. Points with error bars correspond to averages over 25
independent training sets. Points without error bars correspond to best results. NetLines, MonoPlane, and Upstart for N = 25 have nearly the same
performances when trained to reach error-free learning.
We tested the effect of early stopping by imposing on NetLines a maximal
number of two hidden units (H = 2). The residual training error ²t is plotted
on Figure 2, as a function of P. Note that early stopping does not help to decrease ²g . Overfitting, which arises when NetLines is applied until error-free
training is reached, does not degrade the network’s generalization performance. This behavior is very different from the one of networks trained
with backpropagation. The latter reduces classification learning to a regression problem, in which the generalization error can be decomposed in two

competing terms: bias and variance. With backpropagation, early stopping
helps to decrease overfitting because some hidden neurons do not reach
large enough weights to work in the nonlinear part of the sigmoidal transfer functions. All the neurons working in the linear part may be replaced by
a single linear unit. Thus, with early stopping, the network is equivalent to
a smaller one with all the units working in the nonlinear regime. Our results
are consistent with recent theories (Friedman, 1996) showing that, contrary
to regression, the bias and variance components of the generalization error
in classification combine in a highly nonlinear way.
The number of weights used by the different algorithms is plotted on a
logarithmic scale as a function of P in Figure 3. It turns out that the strategy
of NetLines is slightly better than that of MonoPlane with respect to both
generalization performance and network size.
5.2 Real Valued Inputs. We tested NetLines on two problems that have
real valued inputs (we include graded-valued inputs here).

samples of breast cytology, classified as benign or malignant. We excluded
from the original database 16 patterns that have the attribute ξ6 (“bare nuclei”) missing. Among the remaining D = 683 patterns, the two classes are
unevenly represented, 65.5% of the examples being benign. We studied the
generalization performance of networks trained with sets of several sizes P.
The P patterns for each learning test were selected at random. In Figure 4a,
the generalization error at classifying the remaining G ≡ D − P patterns is
displayed as a function of the corresponding number of weights in a logarithmic scale. For comparison, we included in the same figure results of a
single perceptron trained with P = 75 patterns using Minimerror. The results, averaged values over 50 independent tests for each P, show that both
NetLines and MonoPlane have lower ²g and fewer parameters than other
algorithms on this benchmark.
The total number of weights updates needed by NetLines, including the
weights of the dropped output units, is 7 · 104 ; backpropagation needed
≈ 104 (Prechelt, 1994).
The trained network may be used to classify the patterns with missing
attributes. The number of misclassified patterns among the 16 cases for
which attribute ξ6 is missing is plotted as a function of the possible values
of ξ6 on Figure 4b. For large values of ξ6 , there are discrepancies between the
medical and the network’s diagnosis on half the cases. This is an example
of the kind of information that may be obtained in practical applications.

5.2.2 Diabetes Diagnosis. This benchmark (Prechelt, 1994) contains D =
768 patterns described by N = 8 real-valued attributes, corresponding to
≈ 35% of Pima women suffering from diabetes, 65% being healthy. Training
sets of P = 576 patterns were selected at random, and generalization was
tested on the remaining G = 192 patterns. The comparison with published
results obtained with other algorithms tested under the same conditions,
presented in Figure 5, shows that NetLines reaches the best performance
published so far on this benchmark, needing many fewer parameters. Training times of NetLines are of ≈ 105 updates. The numbers of updates needed
by Rprop (Prechelt, 1994) range between 4 · 103 and 5 · 105 , depending on
the network’s architecture.
5.3 Multiclass Problems. We applied our learning algorithm to two different problems, both of three classes. We compare the results obtained with
a WTA classification based on the results of three networks, each independently trained to separate one class from the two others, to the results of
the TON architectures described in section 4. Because the number of classes
is low, we determined the three TONs, corresponding to the three possible

as expected.
5.3.1 Breiman’s Waveform Recognition Problem. This problem was introduced as a test for the algorithm CART (Breiman et al., 1984). The input
patterns are defined by N = 21 real-valued amplitudes x(t) observed at regularly spaced intervals t = 1, 2, . . . , N. Each pattern is a noisy convex linear
combination of two among three elementary waves (triangular waves centered on three different values of t). There are three possible combinations,
and the pattern’s class identifies from which combination it is issued.
We trained the networks with the same 11 training sets of P = 300 examples, and generalization was tested on the same independent test set
of G = 5000, as in Gascuel (1995). Our results are displayed in Figure 6,
where only results of algorithms reaching ²g < 0.25 in Gascuel (1995) are
included. Although it is known that due to the noise, the classification error
has a lower bound of ≈ 14% (Breiman et al., 1984), the results of NetLines
and MonoPlane presented here correspond to error-free training. The networks generated by NetLines have between three and six hidden neurons,
depending on the training sets. The results obtained with a single perceptron trained with Minimerror and with the perceptron learning algorithm,
which may be considered the extreme case of early stopping, are hardly improved by the more complex networks. Here again the overfitting produced
by error-free learning with NetLines does not cause the generalization per-

5.3.2 Fisher’s Iris Plants Database. In this classic three-class problem, one
has to determine the class of iris plants based on the values of N = 4 realvalued attributes. The database of D = 150 patterns contains 50 examples
of each class. Networks were trained with P = 149 patterns, and the generalization error is the mean value of all the 150 leave-one-out possible tests.
Results of ²g are displayed as a function of the number of weights in Figure 7.
Error bars are available for only our own results. In this difficult problem,
the vote of the three possible TONs trained with the three possible class
sequences (see section 4) improves the generalization performance.
6 Conclusion
We presented an incremental learning algorithm for classification, which we
call NetLines. It generates small feedforward neural networks with a single
hidden layer of binary units connected to a binary output neuron. NetLines
allows for an automatic adaptation of the neural network to the complexity
of the particular task. This is achieved by coupling an error-correcting strategy for the successive addition of hidden neurons with Minimerror, a very

efficient perceptron training algorithm. Learning is fast not only because
it reduces the problem to that of training single perceptrons, but mainly
because there is no longer a need for the usual preliminary tests required to
determine the correct architecture for the particular application. Theorems
valid for binary as well as for real-valued inputs guarantee the existence of
a solution with a bounded number of hidden neurons obeying the growth
strategy.
The networks are composed of binary hidden units whose states constitute a faithful encoding of the input patterns. They implement a mapping
from the input space to a discrete H-dimensional hidden space, H being
the number of hidden neurons. Thus, each pattern is labeled with a binary
word of H bits. This encoding may be seen as a compression of the pattern’s
information. The hidden neurons define linear boundaries, or portions of
boundaries, between classes in input space. The network’s output may be
given a probabilistic interpretation based on the distance of the patterns to
these boundaries.
Tests on several benchmarks showed that the networks generated by our
incremental strategy are small, in spite of the fact that the hidden neurons
are appended until error-free learning is reached. Even when the networks
obtained with NetLines are larger than those used by other algorithms, its
generalization error remains among the smallest values reported. In noisy
or difficult problems, it may be useful to stop the network’s growth before

the condition of zero training errors is reached. This decreases overfitting, as
smaller networks (with less parameters) are thus generated. However, the
prediction quality (measured by the generalization error) of the classifiers
generated with NetLines is not improved by early stopping.
Our results were obtained without cross-validation or any data manipulation like boosting, bagging, or arcing (Breiman, 1994; Drucker, Schapire,
& Simard, 1993). Those costly procedures combine results of very large
numbers of classifiers, with the aim of improving the generalization performance through the reduction of the variance. Because NetLines is a stable
classifier, presenting small variance, we do not expect that such techniques
would significantly improve our results.
Appendix
In this appendix we exhibit a particular solution to the learning strategy of
NetLines. This solution is built in such a way that the cardinal of a convex
subset of well-learned patterns, Lh , grows monotonically upon the addition
of hidden units. Because this cardinal cannot be larger than the total number
of training patterns, the algorithm must stop with a finite number of hidden
units.
Suppose that h hidden units have already been included and that the
output neuron still makes classification errors on patterns of the training set,
called training errors. Among these wrongly learned patterns, let ν be the
E h , called hyperplane-h hereafter.
one closest to the hyperplane normal to w
We define Lh as the subset of (correctly learned) patterns lying closer to
hyperplane-h than ξE ν . Patterns in Lh have 0 < γh < |γhν |. The subset Lh and
at least pattern ν are well learned if the next hidden unit, h + 1, has weights:
E h · ξE ν )ê0 ,
E h − (1 − ²h )τhν (w
E h+1 = τhν w
w

(A.1)

where ê0 ≡ (1, 0, . . . , 0). The conditions that both Lh and pattern ν have
positive stabilities (are correctly learned) impose that
µ

0 < ²h < min
µ∈Lh

|γhν | − γh
.
|γhν |

(A.2)

The following weights between the hidden units and the output will give
the correct output to pattern ν and to the patterns of Lh :
W0 (h + 1) = W0 (h) + τ ν
Wi (h + 1) = Wi (h) for 1 ≤ i ≤ h
Wh+1 (h + 1) = −τ ν .

(A.3)
(A.4)
(A.5)

Thus, card(Lh+1 ) ≥ card(Lh ) + 1. As the number of patterns in Lh increases
monotonically with h, convergence is guaranteed with less than P hidden
units.
