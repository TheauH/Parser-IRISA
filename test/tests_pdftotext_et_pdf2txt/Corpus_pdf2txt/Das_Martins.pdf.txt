Abstract

The increasing availability of online information has necessitated intensive
research in the area of automatic text summarization within the Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP) community. Over the past half a century, the prob-
lem has been addressed from many diﬀerent perspectives, in varying domains
and using various paradigms. This survey intends to investigate some of the
most relevant approaches both in the areas of single-document and multiple-
document summarization, giving special emphasis to empirical methods and
extractive techniques. Some promising approaches that concentrate on speciﬁc
details of the summarization problem are also discussed. Special attention is
devoted to automatic evaluation of summarization systems, as future research
on summarization is strongly dependent on progress in this area.

Introduction

The subﬁeld of summarization has been investigated by the NLP community for
nearly the last half century. Radev et al. (2002) deﬁne a summary as “a text that
is produced from one or more texts, that conveys important information in the
original text(s), and that is no longer than half of the original text(s) and usually
signiﬁcantly less than that”. This simple deﬁnition captures three important aspects
that characterize research on automatic summarization:

• Summaries may be produced from a single document or multiple documents,
• Summaries should preserve important information,
• Summaries should be short.
Even if we agree unanimously on these points, it seems from the literature that
any attempt to provide a more elaborate deﬁnition for the task would result in
disagreement within the community. In fact, many approaches diﬀer on the manner
of their problem formulations. We start by introducing some common terms in the

1

summarization dialect: extraction is the procedure of identifying important sections
of the text and producing them verbatim; abstraction aims to produce important
material in a new way; fusion combines extracted parts coherently; and compression
aims to throw out unimportant sections of the text (Radev et al., 2002).

Earliest instances of research on summarizing scientiﬁc documents proposed
paradigms for extracting salient sentences from text using features like word and
phrase frequency (Luhn, 1958), position in the text (Baxendale, 1958) and key
phrases (Edmundson, 1969). Various work published since then has concentrated on
other domains, mostly on newswire data. Many approaches addressed the problem
by building systems depending of the type of the required summary. While extractive
summarization is mainly concerned with what the summary content should be, usu-
ally relying solely on extraction of sentences, abstractive summarization puts strong
emphasis on the form, aiming to produce a grammatical summary, which usually
requires advanced language generation techniques. In a paradigm more tuned to
information retrieval (IR), one can also consider topic-driven summarization, that
assumes that the summary content depends on the preference of the user and can
be assessed via a query, making the ﬁnal summary focused on a particular topic.

A crucial issue that will certainly drive future research on summarization is
evaluation. During the last ﬁfteen years, many system evaluation competitions like
TREC,1 DUC2 and MUC3 have created sets of training material and have estab-
lished baselines for performance levels. However, a universal strategy to evaluate
summarization systems is still absent.

In this survey, we primarily aim to investigate how empirical methods have been
used to build summarization systems. The rest of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 describes single-document summarization, focusing on extractive
techniques. Section 3 progresses to discuss the area of multi-document summariza-
tion, where a few abstractive approaches that pioneered the ﬁeld are also considered.
Section 4 brieﬂy discusses some unconventional approaches that we believe can be
useful in the future of summarization research. Section 5 elaborates a few eval-
uation techniques and describes some of the standards for evaluating summaries
automatically. Finally, Section 6 concludes the survey.

2 Single-Document Summarization

Usually, the ﬂow of information in a given document is not uniform, which means
that some parts are more important than others. The major challenge in summa-
rization lies in distinguishing the more informative parts of a document from the
less ones. Though there have been instances of research describing the automatic
creation of abstracts, most work presented in the literature relies on verbatim ex-
traction of sentences to address the problem of single-document summarization. In

this section, we describe some eminent extractive techniques. First, we look at early
work from the 1950s and 60s that kicked oﬀ research on summarization. Second,
we concentrate on approaches involving machine learning techniques published in
the 1990s to today. Finally, we brieﬂy describe some techniques that use a more
complex natural language analysis to tackle the problem.

2.1 Early Work

Most early work on single-document summarization focused on technical documents.
Perhaps the most cited paper on summarization is that of (Luhn, 1958), that de-
scribes research done at IBM in the 1950s. In his work, Luhn proposed that the
frequency of a particular word in an article provides an useful measure of its sig-
niﬁcance. There are several key ideas put forward in this paper that have assumed
importance in later work on summarization. As a ﬁrst step, words were stemmed to
their root forms, and stop words were deleted. Luhn then compiled a list of content
words sorted by decreasing frequency, the index providing a signiﬁcance measure of
the word. On a sentence level, a signiﬁcance factor was derived that reﬂects the
number of occurrences of signiﬁcant words within a sentence, and the linear distance
between them due to the intervention of non-signiﬁcant words. All sentences are
ranked in order of their signiﬁcance factor, and the top ranking sentences are ﬁnally
selected to form the auto-abstract.

Related work (Baxendale, 1958), also done at IBM and published in the same
journal, provides early insight on a particular feature helpful in ﬁnding salient parts
of documents: the sentence position. Towards this goal, the author examined 200
paragraphs to ﬁnd that in 85% of the paragraphs the topic sentence came as the ﬁrst
one and in 7% of the time it was the last sentence. Thus, a naive but fairly accurate
way to select a topic sentence would be to choose one of these two. This positional
feature has since been used in many complex machine learning based systems.

Edmundson (1969) describes a system that produces document extracts. His
primary contribution was the development of a typical structure for an extractive
summarization experiment. At ﬁrst, the author developed a protocol for creating
manual extracts, that was applied in a set of 400 technical documents. The two
features of word frequency and positional importance were incorporated from the
previous two works. Two other features were used: the presence of cue words
(presence of words like signiﬁcant, or hardly), and the skeleton of the document
(whether the sentence is a title or heading). Weights were attached to each of these
features manually to score each sentence. During evaluation, it was found that about
44% of the auto-extracts matched the manual extracts.

2.2 Machine Learning Methods

In the 1990s, with the advent of machine learning techniques in NLP, a series of semi-
nal publications appeared that employed statistical techniques to produce document
extracts. While initially most systems assumed feature independence and relied on
naive-Bayes methods, others have focused on the choice of appropriate features and

3

on learning algorithms that make no independence assumptions. Other signiﬁcant
approaches involved hidden Markov models and log-linear models to improve ex-
tractive summarization. A very recent paper, in contrast, used neural networks and
third party features (like common words in search engine queries) to improve purely
extractive single document summarization. We next describe all these approaches
in more detail.

2.2.1 Naive-Bayes Methods

Kupiec et al. (1995) describe a method derived from Edmundson (1969) that is able
to learn from data. The classiﬁcation function categorizes each sentence as worthy
of extraction or not, using a naive-Bayes classiﬁer. Let s be a particular sentence,
S the set of sentences that make up the summary, and F1, . . . , Fk the features.
Assuming independence of the features:

P (s ∈ S | F1, F2, ..Fk) =

(1)

(cid:81)k
i=1 P (Fi | s ∈ S) · P (s ∈ S)

(cid:81)k

i=1 P (Fi)

The features were compliant to (Edmundson, 1969), but additionally included the
sentence length and the presence of uppercase words. Each sentence was given a
score according to (1), and only the n top sentences were extracted. To evaluate
the system, a corpus of technical documents with manual abstracts was used in
the following way: for each sentence in the manual abstract, the authors manually
analyzed its match with the actual document sentences and created a mapping
(e.g. exact match with a sentence, matching a join of two sentences, not matchable,
etc.). The auto-extracts were then evaluated against this mapping. Feature analysis
revealed that a system using only the position and the cue features, along with the
sentence length sentence feature, performed best.

Aone et al. (1999) also incorporated a naive-Bayes classiﬁer, but with richer
features. They describe a system called DimSum that made use of features like
term frequency (tf ) and inverse document frequency (idf) to derive signature words.4
The idf was computed from a large corpus of the same domain as the concerned
documents. Statistically derived two-noun word collocations were used as units for
counting, along with single words. A named-entity tagger was used and each entity
was considered as a single token. They also employed some shallow discourse analysis
like reference to same entities in the text, maintaining cohesion. The references
were resolved at a very shallow level by linking name aliases within a document
like “U.S.” to “United States”, or “IBM” for “International Business Machines”.
Synonyms and morphological variants were also merged while considering lexical
terms, the former being identiﬁed by using Wordnet (Miller, 1995). The corpora
used in the experiments were from newswire, some of which belonged to the TREC
evaluations.

2.2.2 Rich Features and Decision Trees

Lin and Hovy (1997) studied the importance of a single feature, sentence position.
Just weighing a sentence by its position in text, which the authors term as the
“position method”, arises from the idea that texts generally follow a predictable
discourse structure, and that the sentences of greater topic centrality tend to occur in
certain speciﬁable locations (e.g. title, abstracts, etc). However, since the discourse
structure signiﬁcantly varies over domains, the position method cannot be deﬁned
as naively as in (Baxendale, 1958). The paper makes an important contribution by
investigating techniques of tailoring the position method towards optimality over a
genre and how it can be evaluated for eﬀectiveness. A newswire corpus was used, the
collection of Ziﬀ-Davis texts produced from the TIPSTER5 program; it consists of
text about computer and related hardware, accompanied by a set of key topic words
and a small abstract of six sentences. For each document in the corpus, the authors
measured the yield of each sentence position against the topic keywords. They then
ranked the sentence positions by their average yield to produce the Optimal Position
Policy (OPP) for topic positions for the genre.

Two kinds of evaluation were performed. Previously unseen text was used for
testing whether the same procedure would work in a diﬀerent domain. The ﬁrst
evaluation showed contours exactly like the training documents. In the second eval-
uation, word overlap of manual abstracts with the extracted sentences was measured.
Windows in abstracts were compared with windows on the selected sentences and
corresponding precision and recall values were measured. A high degree of coverage
indicated the eﬀectiveness of the position method.

In later work, Lin (1999) broke away from the assumption that features are
independent of each other and tried to model the problem of sentence extraction
using decision trees, instead of a naive-Bayes classiﬁer. He examined a lot of fea-
tures and their eﬀect on sentence extraction. The data used in this work is a
publicly available collection of texts, classiﬁed into various topics, provided by the
TIPSTER-SUMMAC6 evaluations, targeted towards information retrieval systems.
The dataset contains essential text fragments (phrases, clauses, and sentences) which
must be included in summaries to answer some TREC topics. These fragments were
each evaluated by a human judge. The experiments described in the paper are with
the SUMMARIST system developed at the University of Southern California. The
system extracted sentences from the documents and those were matched against
human extracts, like most early work on extractive summarization.

Some novel features were the query signature (normalized score given to sen-
tences depending on number of query words that they contain), IR signature (the
m most salient words in the corpus, similar to the signature words of (Aone et al.,
1999)), numerical data (boolean value 1 given to sentences that contained a num-
ber in them), proper name (boolean value 1 given to sentences that contained a
proper name in them), pronoun or adjective (boolean value 1 given to sentences

that contained a pronoun or adjective in them), weekday or month (similar as pre-
vious feature) and quotation (similar as previous feature). It is worth noting that
some features like the query signature are question-oriented because of the setting
of the evaluation, unlike a generalized summarization framework.

The author experimented with various baselines, like using only the positional
feature, or using a simple combination of all features by adding their values. When
evaluated by matching machine extracted and human extracted sentences, the deci-
sion tree classiﬁer was clearly the winner for the whole dataset, but for three topics,
a naive combination of features beat it. Lin conjectured that this happened because
some of the features were independent of each other. Feature analysis suggested
that the IR signature was a valuable feature, corroborating the early ﬁndings of
Luhn (1958).

2.2.3 Hidden Markov Models

In contrast with previous approaches, that were mostly feature-based and non-
sequential, Conroy and O’leary (2001) modeled the problem of extracting a sentence
from a document using a hidden Markov model (HMM). The basic motivation for
using a sequential model is to account for local dependencies between sentences.
Only three features were used: position of the sentence in the document (built into
the state structure of the HMM), number of terms in the sentence, and likeliness of
the sentence terms given the document terms.

Figure 1: Markov model to extract to three summary sentences from a document
(Conroy and O’leary, 2001).

The HMM was structured as follows: it contained 2s + 1 states, alternating be-
tween s summary states and s+1 nonsummary states. The authors allowed “hesita-
tion” only in nonsummary states and “skipping next state” only in summary states.
Figure 1 shows an example HMM with 7 nodes, corresponding to s = 3. Using the
TREC dataset as training corpus, the authors obtained the maximum-likelihood
estimate for each transition probability, forming the transition matrix estimate ˆM,
whose element (i, j) is the empirical probability of transitioning from state i to j.
Associated with each state i was an output function, bi(O) = Pr(O | state i) where
O is an observed vector of features. They made a simplifying assumption that the
features are multivariate normal. The output function for each state was thus esti-
mated by using the training data to compute the maximum likelihood estimate of
its mean and covariance matrix. They estimated 2s + 1 means, but assumed that all
of the output functions shared a common covariance matrix. Evaluation was done

2.2.4 Log-Linear Models

Osborne (2002) claims that existing approaches to summarization have always as-
sumed feature independence. The author used log-linear models to obviate this
assumption and showed empirically that the system produced better extracts than
a naive-Bayes model, with a prior appended to both models. Let c be a label, s
the item we are interested in labeling, fi the i-th feature, and λi the corresponding
feature weight. The conditional log-linear model used by Osborne (2002) can be
stated as follows:

(cid:33)

,

where Z(s) = (cid:80)

c exp ((cid:80)

P (c | s) =

Z(s)

exp

i λifi(c, s)). In this domain, there are only two possible
labels: either the sentence is to be extracted or it is not. The weights were trained
by conjugate gradient descent. The authors added a non-uniform prior to the model,
claiming that a log-linear model tends to reject too many sentences for inclusion in
a summary. The same prior was also added to a naive-Bayes model for comparison.
The classiﬁcation took place as follows:

(cid:32)(cid:88)

i

label(s) = arg max
c∈C

P (c) · P (s, c) = arg max
c∈C

λifi(c, s)

.

(3)

The authors optimized the prior using the f2 score of the classiﬁer as an objective
function on a part of the dataset (in the technical domain). The summaries were
evaluated using the standard f2 score where f2 = 2pr
p+r , where the precision and recall
measures were measured against human generated extracts. The features included
word pairs (pairs of words with all words truncated to ten characters), sentence
length, sentence position, and naive discourse features like inside introduction or
inside conclusion. With respect to f2 score, the log-linear model outperformed the
naive-Bayes classiﬁer with the prior, exhibiting the former’s eﬀectiveness.

2.2.5 Neural Networks and Third Party Features

In 2001-02, DUC issued a task of creating a 100-word summary of a single news
article. However, the best performing systems in the evaluations could not outper-
form the baseline with statistical signiﬁcance. This extremely strong baseline has
been analyzed by Nenkova (2005) and corresponds to the selection of the ﬁrst n
sentences of a newswire article. This surprising result has been attributed to the
journalistic convention of putting the most important part of an article in the initial
paragraphs. After 2002, the task of single-document summarization for newswire
was dropped from DUC. Svore et al. (2007) propose an algorithm based on neu-
ral nets and the use of third party datasets to tackle the problem of extractive
summarization, outperforming the baseline with statistical signiﬁcance.

7

The authors used a dataset containing 1365 documents gathered from CNN.com,
each consisting of the title, timestamp, three or four human generated story high-
lights and the article text. They considered the task of creating three machine
highlights. The human generated highlights were not verbatim extractions from the
article itself. The authors evaluated their system using two metrics: the ﬁrst one
concatenated the three highlights produced by the system, concatenated the three
human generated highlights, and compared these two blocks; the second metric con-
sidered the ordering and compared the sentences on an individual level.

Svore et al. (2007) trained a model from the labels and the features for each
sentence of an article, that could infer the proper ranking of sentences in a test
document. The ranking was accomplished using RankNet (Burges et al., 2005), a
pair-based neural network algorithm designed to rank a set of inputs that uses the
gradient descent method for training. For the training set, they used ROUGE-1
(Lin, 2004) to score the similarity of a human written highlight and a sentence
in the document. These similarity scores were used as soft labels during training,
contrasting with other approaches where sentences are “hard-labeled”, as selected
or not.

Some of the used features based on position or n-grams frequencies have been
observed in previous work. However, the novelty of the framework lay in the use
of features that derived information from query logs from Microsoft’s news search
engine7 and Wikipedia8 entries. The authors conjecture that if a document sentence
contained keywords used in the news search engine, or entities found in Wikipedia
articles, then there is a greater chance of having that sentence in the highlight. The
extracts were evaluated using ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2, and showed statistically
signiﬁcant improvements over the baseline of selecting the ﬁrst three sentences in a
document.

2.3 Deep Natural Language Analysis Methods

In this subsection, we describe a set of papers that detail approaches towards single-
document summarization involving complex natural language analysis techniques.
None of these papers solve the problem using machine learning, but rather use a set
of heuristics to create document extracts. Most of these techniques try to model the
text’s discourse structure.

Barzilay and Elhadad (1997) describe a work that used considerable amount of
linguistic analysis for performing the task of summarization. For a better under-
standing of their method, we need to deﬁne a lexical chain: it is a sequence of related
words in a text, spanning short (adjacent words or sentences) or long distances (en-
tire text). The authors’ method progressed with the following steps: segmentation
of the text, identiﬁcation of lexical chains, and using strong lexical chains to identify
the sentences worthy of extraction. They tried to reach a middle ground between
(McKeown and Radev, 1995) and (Luhn, 1958) where the former relied on deep

semantic structure of the text, while the latter relied on word statistics of the doc-
uments. The authors describe the notion of cohesion in text as a means of sticking
together diﬀerent parts of the text. Lexical cohesion is a notable example where
semantically related words are used. For example, let us take a look at the following
sentence.9

John bought a Jag. He loves the car.

(4)
Here, the word car refers to the word Jag in the previous sentence, and exempliﬁes
lexical cohesion. The phenomenon of cohesion occurs not only at the word level,
but at word sequences too, resulting in lexical chains, which the authors used as
a source representation for summarization. Semantically related words and word
sequences were identiﬁed in the document, and several chains were extracted, that
form a representation of the document. To ﬁnd out lexical chains, the authors used
Wordnet (Miller, 1995), applying three generic steps:

1. Selecting a set of candidate words.

2. For each candidate word, ﬁnding an appropriate chain relying on a relatedness

criterion among members of the chains,

3. If it is found, inserting the word in the chain and updating it accordingly.

The relatedness was measured in terms of Wordnet distance. Simple nouns and
noun compounds were used as starting point to ﬁnd the set of candidates. In the
ﬁnal steps, strong lexical chains were used to create the summaries. The chains were
scored by their length and homogeneity. Then the authors used a few heuristics to
select the signiﬁcant sentences.

In another paper, Ono et al. (1994) put forward a computational model of dis-
course for Japanese expository writings, where they elaborate a practical procedure
for extracting the discourse rhetorical structure, a binary tree representing relations
between chunks of sentences (rhetorical structure trees are used more intensively in
(Marcu, 1998a), as we will see below). This structure was extracted using a series
of NLP steps: sentence analysis, rhetorical relation extraction, segmentation, can-
didate generation and preference judgement. Evaluation was based on the relative
importance of rhetorical relations. In the following step, the nodes of the rhetori-
cal structure tree were pruned to reduce the sentence, keeping its important parts.
Same was done for paragraphs to ﬁnally produce the summary. Evaluation was done
with respect to sentence coverage and 30 editorial articles of a Japanese newspaper
were used as the dataset. The articles had corresponding sets of key sentences and
most important key sentences judged by human subjects. The key sentence coverage
was about 51% and the most important key sentence coverage was 74%, indicating
encouraging results.

Marcu (1998a) describes a unique approach towards summarization that, unlike
most other previous work, does not assume that the sentences in a document form
a ﬂat sequence. This paper used discourse based heuristics with the traditional

features that have been used in the summarization literature. The discourse theory
used in this paper is the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) that holds between
two non-overlapping pieces of text spans: the nucleus and the satellite. The author
mentions that the distinction between nuclei and satellites comes from the empir-
ical observation that the nucleus expresses what is more essential to the writer’s
purpose than the satellite; and that the nucleus of a rhetorical relation is compre-
hensible independent of the satellite, but not vice versa. Marcu (1998b) describes
the details of a rhetorical parser producing a discourse tree. Figure 2 shows an
example discourse tree for a text example detailed in the paper. Once such a dis-

Figure 2: Example of a discourse tree from Marcu (1998a). The numbers in the
nodes denote sentence numbers from the text example. The text below the number

the normals ones are the NUCLEI.

course structure is created, a partial ordering of important units can be developed
from the tree. Each equivalence class in the partial ordering is derived from the
new sentences at a particular level of the discourse tree. In Figure 2, we observe
that sentence 2 is at the root, followed by sentence 8 in the second level. In the
third level, sentence 3 and 10 are observed, and so forth. The equivalence classes
are 2 > 8 > 3, 10 > 1, 4, 5, 7, 9 > 6.

If it is speciﬁed that the summary should contain the top k% of the text, the ﬁrst
k% of the units in the partial ordering can be selected to produce the summary. The
author talks about a summarization system based just on this method in (Marcu,
1998b) and in one of his earlier papers.
In this paper, he merged the discourse
based heuristics with traditional heuristics. The metrics used were clustering based

10

score was 0, for the internal nodes it was given by the similarity of the immediate
children; discourse tree A was chosen to be better than B if its clustering score
was higher), marker based metric (a discourse structure A was chosen to be better
than a discourse structure B if A used more rhetorical relations than B), rhetorical
clustering based technique (measured the similarity between salient units of two text
spans), shape based metric (preferred a discourse tree A over B if A was more skewed
towards the right than B), title based metric, position based metric, connectedness
based metric (cosine similarity of an unit to all other text units, a discourse structure
A was chosen to be better than B if its connectedness measure was more than B).
A weighted linear combination of all these scores gave the score of a discourse
structure. To ﬁnd the best combination of heuristics, the author computed the
weights that maximized the F-score on the training dataset, which was constituted
by newswire articles. To do this, he used a GSAT-like algorithm (Selman et al.,
1992) that performed a greedy search in a seven dimensional space of the metrics.
For a part of his corpus (the TREC dataset), a best F-score of 75.42% was achieved
for the 10% summaries which was 3.5% higher than a baseline lead based algorithm,
which was very encouraging.

3 Multi-Document Summarization

Extraction of a single summary from multiple documents has gained interest since
mid 1990s, most applications being in the domain of news articles. Several Web-
based news clustering systems were inspired by research on multi-document summa-
rization, for example Google News,10 Columbia NewsBlaster,11 or News In Essence.12
This departs from single-document summarization since the problem involves mul-
tiple sources of information that overlap and supplement each other, being contra-
dictory at occasions. So the key tasks are not only identifying and coping with
redundancy across documents, but also recognizing novelty and ensuring that the
ﬁnal summary is both coherent and complete.

The ﬁeld seems to have been pioneered by the NLP group at Columbia University
(McKeown and Radev, 1995), where a summarization system called SUMMONS13
was developed by extending already existing technology for template-driven message
understanding systems. Although in that early stage multi-document summariza-
tion was mainly seen as a task requiring substantial capabilities of both language
interpretation and generation, it later gained autonomy, as people coming from dif-
ferent communities added new perspectives to the problem. Extractive techniques
have been applied, making use of similarity measures between pairs of sentences.
Approaches vary on how these similarities are used: some identify common themes
through clustering and then select one sentence to represent each cluster (McKeown

et al., 1999; Radev et al., 2000), others generate a composite sentence from each
cluster (Barzilay et al., 1999), while some approaches work dynamically by includ-
ing each candidate passage only if it is considered novel with respect to the previous
included passages, via maximal marginal relevance (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998).
Some recent work extends multi-document summarization to multilingual environ-
ments (Evans, 2005).

The way the problem is posed has also varied over time. While in some pub-
lications it is claimed that extractive techniques would not be eﬀective for multi-
document summarization (McKeown and Radev, 1995; McKeown et al., 1999), some
years later that claim was overturned, as extractive systems like MEAD14 (Radev
et al., 2000) achieved good performance in large scale summarization of news arti-
cles. This can be explained by the fact that summarization systems often distinguish
among themselves about what their goal actually is. While some systems, like SUM-
MONS, are designed to work in strict domains, aiming to build a sort of brieﬁng
that highlights diﬀerences and updates accross diﬀerent news reports, putting much
emphasis on how information is presented to the user, others, like MEAD, are large
scale systems that intend to work in general domains, being more concerned with
information content rather than form. Consequently, systems of the former kind re-
quire a strong eﬀort on language generation to produce a grammatical and coherent
summary, while latter systems are probably more close to the information retrieval
paradigm. Abstractive systems like SUMMONS are diﬃcult to replicate, as they
heavily rely on the adaptation of internal tools to perform information extraction
and language generation. On the other hand, extractive systems are generally easy
to implement from scratch, and this makes them appealing when sophisticated NLP
tools are not available.

3.1 Abstraction and Information Fusion

As far as we know, SUMMONS (McKeown and Radev, 1995; Radev and McKeown,
1998) is the ﬁrst historical example of a multi-document summarization system. It
tackles single events about a narrow domain (news articles about terrorism) and
produces a brieﬁng merging relevant information about each event and how reports
by diﬀerent news agencies have evolved over time. The whole thread of reports is
then presented, as illustrated in the following example of a “good” summary:

“In the afternoon of February 26, 1993, Reuters reported that a suspect
bomb killed at least ﬁve people in the World Trade Center. However,
Associated Press announced that exactly ﬁve people were killed in the
blast. Finally, Associated Press announced that Arab terrorists were
possibly responsible for the terrorist act.”

summarizer is built by concatenating the two systems, ﬁrst processing full text as
input and ﬁlling template slots, and then synthesizing a summary from the extracted
information. The architecture of SUMMONS consists of two major components: a
content planner that selects the information to include in the summary through
combination of the input templates, and a linguistic generator that selects the right
words to express the information in grammatical and coherent text. The latter
component was devised by adapting existing language generation tools, namely the
FUF/SURGE system15. Content planning, on the other hand, is made through
summary operators, a set of heuristic rules that perform operations like “change of
perspective”, “contradiction”, “reﬁnement”, etc. Some of these operations require
resolving conﬂicts, i.e., contradictory information among diﬀerent sources or time
instants; others complete pieces of information that are included in some articles
and not in others, combining them into a single template. At the end, the linguis-
tic generator gathers all the combined information and uses connective phrases to
synthesize a summary.

While this framework seems promising when the domain is narrow enough so that
the templates can be designed by hand, a generalization for broader domains would
be problematic. This was improved later by McKeown et al. (1999) and Barzilay
et al. (1999), where the input is now a set of related documents in raw text, like
those retrieved by a standard search engine in response to a query. The system starts
by identifying themes, i.e., sets of similar text units (usually paragraphs). This is
formulated as a clustering problem. To compute a similarity measure between text
units, these are mapped to vectors of features, that include single words weighted
by their TF-IDF scores, noun phrases, proper nouns, synsets from the Wordnet
database and a database of semantic classes of verbs. For each pair of paragraphs, a
vector is computed that represents matches on the diﬀerent features. Decision rules
that were learned from data are then used to classify each pair of text units either
as similar or dissimilar; this in turn feeds a subsequent algorithm that places the
most related paragraphs in the same theme.

Once themes are identiﬁed, the system enters its second stage: information fu-
sion. The goal is to decide which sentences of a theme should be included in the
summary. Rather than just picking a sentence that is a group representative, the
authors propose an algorithm which compares and intersects predicate argument
structures of the phrases within each theme to determine which are repeated often
enough to be included in the summary. This is done as follows: ﬁrst, sentences are
parsed through Collins’ statistical parser (Collins, 1999) and converted into depen-
dency trees, which allows capturing the predicate-argument structure and identify
functional roles. Determiners and auxiliaries are dropped; Fig. 3 shows a sentence
representation.

The comparison algorithm then traverses these dependency trees recursively,
adding identical nodes to the output tree. Once full phrases (a verb with at least
two constituents) are found, they are marked to be included in the summary. If two

phrases, rooted at some node, are not identical but yet similar, the hypothesis that
they are paraphrases of each other is considered; to take this into account, corpus-
driven paraphrasing rules are written to allow paraphrase intersection.16 Once the
summary content (represented as predicate-argument structures) is decided, a gram-
matical text is generated by translating those structures into the arguments expected
by the FUF/SURGE language generation system.

3.2 Topic-driven Summarization and MMR

Carbonell and Goldstein (1998) made a major contribution to topic-driven sum-
marization by introducing the maximal marginal relevance (MMR) measure. The
idea is to combine query relevance with information novelty; it may be applicable
in several tasks ranging from text retrieval to topic-driven summarization. MMR
simultaneously rewards relevant sentences and penalizes redundant ones by consid-
ering a linear combination of two similarity measures.

Let Q be a query or user proﬁle and R a ranked list of documents retrieved by
a search engine. Consider an incremental procedure that selects documents, one at
a time, and adds them to a set S. So let S be the set of already selected documents
in a particular step, and R \ S the set of yet unselected documents in R. For each
candidate document Di ∈ R \ S, its marginal relevance MR(Di) is computed as:

MR(Di) := λSim1(Di, Q) − (1 − λ) max
Dj∈S

Sim2(Di, Dj)

(5)

where λ is a parameter lying in [0, 1] that controls the relative importance given
to relevance versus redundancy. Sim1 and Sim2 are two similarity measures; in the

16A full description of the kind of paraphrasing rules used can be found in (Barzilay et al.,
1999). Examples are: ordering of sentence components, main clause vs. relative clause, realization
in diﬀerent syntactic categories (e.g. classiﬁer vs. apposition), change in grammatical features
(active/passive, time, number, etc.), head omission, transformation from one POS to another,
using semantically related words (e.g. synonyms), etc.

(cid:107)x(cid:107)·(cid:107)y(cid:107). The document achieving the
highest marginal relevance, DMMR = arg maxDi∈R\S MR(Di), is then selected, i.e.,
added to S, and the procedure continues until a maximum number of documents
are selected or a minimum relevance threshold is attained. Carbonell and Goldstein
(1998) found experimentally that choosing dynamically the value of λ turns out to be
more eﬀective than keeping it ﬁxed, namely starting with small values (λ ≈ 0.3) to
give more emphasis to novelty, and then increasing it (λ ≈ 0.7) to focus on the most
relevant documents. To perform summarization, documents can be ﬁrst segmented
into sentences or paragraphs, and after a query is submitted, the MMR algorithm
can be applied followed by a selection of the top ranking passages, reordering them as
they appeared in the original documents, and presenting the result as the summary.
One of the attractive points in using MMR for summarization is its topic-oriented
feature, through its dependency on the query Q, which makes it particularly ap-
pealing to generate summaries according to a user proﬁle: as the authors claim, “a
diﬀerent user with diﬀerent information needs may require a totally diﬀerent sum-
mary of the same document.” This assertion was not being taken into account by
previous multi-document summarization systems.

3.3 Graph Spreading Activation

Mani and Bloedorn (1997) describe an information extraction framework for sum-
marization, a graph-based method to ﬁnd similarities and dissimilarities in pairs
of documents. Albeit no textual summary is generated, the summary content is
represented via entities (concepts) and relations that are displayed respectively as
nodes and edges of a graph. Rather than extracting sentences, they detect salient
regions of the graph via a spreading activation technique.17

This approach shares with the method described in Section 3.2 the property
of being topic-driven; there is an additional input that stands for the topic with
respect to which the summary is to be generated. The topic is represented through
a set of entry nodes in the graph. A document is represented as a graph as follows:
each node represents the occurrence of a single word (i.e., one word together with
its position in the text). Each node can have several kinds of links: adjacency
links (ADJ) to adjacent words in the text, SAME links to other occurrences of the
same word, and ALPHA links encoding semantic relationships captured through
Wordnet and NetOwl18. Besides these, PHRASE links tie together sequences of
adjacent nodes which belong to the same phrase, and NAME and COREF links
stand for co-referential name occurrences; Fig. 4 shows some of these links.

Once the graph is built, topic nodes are identiﬁed by stem comparison and be-
come the entry nodes. A search for semantically related text is then propagated from
these to the other nodes of the graph, in a process called spreading activation. Salient

17The name “spreading activation” is borrowed from a method used in information retrieval

(Salton and Buckley, 1988) to expand the search vocabulary.

words and phrases are initialized according to their TF-IDF score. The weight of
neighboring nodes depends on the node link traveled and is an exponentially decay-
ing function of the distance of the traversed path. Traveling within a sentence is
made cheaper than across sentence boundaries, which in turn is cheaper than across
paragraph boundaries. Given a pair of document graphs, common nodes are identi-
ﬁed either by sharing the same stem or by being synonyms. Analogously, diﬀerence
nodes are those that are not common. For each sentence in both documents, two
scores are computed: one score that reﬂects the presence of common nodes, which
is computed as the average weight of these nodes; and another score that computes
instead the average weights of diﬀerence nodes. Both scores are computed after
spreading activation. In the end, the sentences that have higher common and dif-
ferent scores are highlighted, the user being able to specify the maximal number of
common and diﬀerent sentences to control the output. In the future, the authors
expect to use these structure to actually compose abstractive summaries, rather
than just highlighting pieces of text.

3.4 Centroid-based Summarization

Although clustering techniques were already being employed by McKeown et al.
(1999) and Barzilay et al. (1999) for identiﬁcation of themes, Radev et al. (2000)
pioneered the use of cluster centroids to play a central role in summarization. A full
description of the centroid-based approach that underlies the MEAD system can
be found in (Radev et al., 2004); here we sketch brieﬂy the main points. Perhaps
the most appealing feature is the fact that it does not make use of any language
generation module, unlike most previous systems. All documents are modeled as
bags-of-words. The system is also easily scalable and domain-independent.

The ﬁrst stage consists of topic detection, whose goal is to group together news
articles that describe the same event. To accomplish this task, an agglomerative
clustering algorithm is used that operates over the TF-IDF vector representations
of the documents, successively adding documents to clusters and recomputing the

where cj is the centroid of the j-th cluster, Cj is the set of documents that belong
to that cluster, its cardinality being |Cj|, and ˜d is a “truncated version” of d that
vanishes on those words whose TF-IDF scores are below a threshold. Centroids
can thus be regarded as pseudo-documents that include those words whose TF-
IDF scores are above a threshold in the documents that constitute the cluster. Each
event cluster is a collection of (typically 2 to 10) news articles from multiple sources,
chronologically ordered, describing an event as it develops over time.

The second stage uses the centroids to identify sentences in each cluster that
are central to the topic of the entire cluster. In (Radev et al., 2000), two metrics
are deﬁned that resemble the two summands in the MMR (see Section 3.2): cluster-
based relative utility (CBRU) and cross-sentence informational subsumption (CSIS).
The ﬁrst accounts for how relevant a particular sentence is to the general topic of
the entire cluster; the second is a measure of redundancy among sentences. Unlike
MMR, these metrics are not query-dependent. Given one cluster C of documents
segmented into n sentences, and a compression rate R, a sequence of nR sentences
are extracted in the same order as they appear in the original documents, which in
turn are ordered chronologically. The selection of the sentences is made by approx-
imating their CBRU and CSIS.19 For each sentence si, three diﬀerent features are
used:

• Its centroid value (Ci), deﬁned as the sum of the centroid values of all the

words in the sentence,

• A positional value (Pi), that is used to make leading sentences more important.
Let Cmax be the centroid value of the highest ranked sentence in the document.
Then Pi = n−i+1

n Cmax.

• The ﬁrst-sentence overlap (Fi), deﬁned as the inner product between the word
occurrence vector of sentence i and that of the ﬁrst sentence of the document.

The ﬁnal score of each sentence is a combination of the three scores above minus a
redundancy penalty (Rs) for each sentence that overlaps highly ranked sentences.

3.5 Multilingual Multi-document Summarization

Evans (2005) addresses the task of summarizing documents written in multiple
languages; this had already been sketched by Hovy and Lin (1999). Multilingual
summarization is still at an early stage, but this framework looks quite useful for
newswire applications that need to combine information from foreign news agen-
cies. Evans (2005) considered the scenario where there is a preferred language in
which the summary is to be written, and multiple documents in the preferred and

19The two metrics are used directly for evaluation (see (Radev et al., 2004) for more details).

17

in foreign languages are available. In their experiments, the preferred language was
English and the documents are news articles in English and Arabic. The rationale is
to summarize the English articles without discarding the information contained in
the Arabic documents. The IBM’s statistical machine translation system is ﬁrst ap-
plied to translate the Arabic documents to English. Then a search is made, for each
translated text unit, to see whether there is a similar sentence or not in the English
documents. If so, and if the sentence is found relevant enough to be included in the
summary, the similar English sentence is included instead of the Arabic-to-English
translation. This way, the ﬁnal summary is more likely to be grammatical, since
machine translation is known to be far from perfect. On the other hand, the result
is also expected to have higher coverage than using just the English documents,
since the information contained in the Arabic documents can help to decide about
the relevance of each sentence. In order to measure similarity between sentences, a
tool named SimFinder 20 was employed: this is a tool for clustering text based on
similarity over a variety of lexical and syntactic features using a log-linear regression
model.

4 Other Approaches to Summarization

This section describes brieﬂy some unconventional approaches that, rather than
aiming to build full summarization systems, investigate some details that underlie
the summarization process, and that we conjecture to have a role to play in future
research on this ﬁeld.

4.1 Short Summaries

Witbrock and Mittal (1999) claim that extractive summarization is not very pow-
erful in that the extracts are not concise enough when very short summaries are
required. They present a system that generated headline style summaries. The cor-
pus used in this work was newswire articles from Reuters and the Associated Press,
publicly available at the LDC21. The system learned statistical models of the rela-
tionship between source text units and headline units. It attempted to model both
the order and the likelihood of the appearance of tokens in the target documents.
Both the models, one for content selection and the other for surface realization were
used to co-constrain each other during the search in the summary generation task.
For content selection, the model learned a translation model between a docu-
ment and its summary (Brown et al., 1993). This model in the simplest case can be
thought as a mapping between a word in the document and the likelihood of some
word appearing in the summary. To simplify the model, the authors assumed that
the probability of a word appearing in a summary is independent of its structure.
This mapping boils down to the fact that the probability of a particular summary

20See http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/nlp/tools.cgi#SimFinder.
21See http://ldc.upenn.edu.

18

candidate is the product of the probabilities of the summary content and that con-
tent being expressed using a particular structure.

The surface realization model used was a bigram model. Viterbi beam search
was used to eﬃciently ﬁnd a near-optimal summary. The Markov assumption was
violated by using backtracking at every state to strongly discourage paths that
repeated terms, since bigrams that start repeating often seem to pathologically
overwhelm the search otherwise. To evaluate the system, the authors compared
its output against the actual headlines for a set of input newswire stories. Since
phrasing could not be compared, they compared the generated headlines against
the actual headlines, as well as the top ranked summary sentence of the story. Since
the system did not have a mechanism to determine the optimal length of a headline,
six headlines for each story were generated, ranging in length from 4 to 10 words
and they measured the term-overlap between each of the generated headlines and
the test. For headline length 4, there was 0.89 overlap in the headline and there was
0.91 overlap amongst the top scored sentence, indicating useful results.

4.2 Sentence Compression

Knight and Marcu (2000) introduced a statistical approach to sentence compression.
The authors believe that understanding the simpler task of compressing a sentence
may be a fruitful ﬁrst step to later tackle the problems of single and multi-document
summarization.

Sentence compression is deﬁned as follows: given a sequence of words W =
w1w2 . . . wn that constitute a sentence, ﬁnd a subsequence wi1wi2 . . . wik, with
1 ≤ i1 < i2 < . . . ik ≤ n, that is a compressed version of W . Note that there
are 2n possibilities of output. Knight and Marcu (2000) considered two diﬀerent
approaches: one that is inspired by the noisy-channel model, and another one based
on decision trees. Due to its simplicity and elegance, we describe the ﬁrst approach
here.

The noisy-channel model considers that one starts with a short summary s,
drawn according to the source model P (s), which is then subject to channel noise to
become the full sentence t, in a process guided by the channel model P (t|s). When
the string t is observed, one wants to recover the original summary according to:

ˆs = arg max

s

P (s|t) = arg max

s

P (s)P (t|s).

(7)

This model has the advantage of decoupling the goals of producing a short text that
looks grammatical (incorporated in the source model) and of preserving important
information (which is done through the channel model).
In (Knight and Marcu,
2000), the source and channel models are simple models inspired by probabilistic
context-free grammars (PCFGs). The following probability mass functions are de-
ﬁned over parse trees rather than strings: Ptree(s), the probability of a parse tree
that generates s, and Pexpand tree(t|s), the probability that a small parse tree that
generates s is expanded to a longer one that generates t.

19

The sentence t is ﬁrst parsed by using Collins’ parser (Collins, 1999). Then,
rather than computing Ptree(s) over all the 2n hypotheses for s, which would be
exponential in the sentence length, a shaded-forest structure is used: the parse
tree of t is traversed and the grammar (learned from the Penn Treebank22) is used
to check recursively which nodes may be removed from each production in order
to achieve another valid production. This algorithm allows to compute eﬃciently
Ptree(s) and Pexpand tree(t|s) for all possible grammatical summaries s. Conceptually,
the noisy channel model works the other way around: summaries are the original
strings that are expanded via expansion templates. Expansion operations have the
eﬀect of decreasing the probability Pexpand tree(t|s). The probabilities Ptree(s) and
Pexpand tree(t|s) consist in the usual factorized expression for PCFGs times a bigram
distribution over the leaves of the tree (i.e. the words). In the end, the log probability
is (heuristically) divided by the length of the sentence s in order not to penalize
excessively longer sentences (this is done commonly in speech recognition).

More recently, Daum´e III and Marcu (2002) extended this approach to document
compression by using rhetorical structure theory as in Marcu (1998a), where the
entire document is represented as a tree, hence allowing not only to compress relevant
sentences, but also to drop irrelevant ones. In this framework, Daum´e III and Marcu
(2004) employed kernel methods to decide for each node in the tree whether or not
it should be kept.

4.3 Sequential document representation

We conclude this section by mentioning some recent work that concerns document
representation, with applications in summarization. In the bag-of-words representa-
tion (Salton et al., 1975) each document is represented as a sparse vector in a very
large Euclidean space, indexed by words in the vocabulary V . A well-known tech-
nique in information retrieval to capture word correlation is latent semantic indexing
(LSI), that aims to ﬁnd a linear subspace of dimension k ≤ |V | where documents
may be approximately represented by their projections.

These classical approaches assume by convenience that Euclidean geometry is
a proper model for text documents. As an alternative, Gous (1999) and Hall and
Hofmann (2000) used the framework of information geometry (Amari and Nagaoka,
2001) to generalize LSI to the multinomial manifold, which can be identiﬁed with
the probability simplex

xi = 1, xi ≥ 0 for i = 1, . . . , n

.

(8)

i=1

Instead of ﬁnding a linear subspace, as in the Euclidean case, they learn a subman-
ifold of Pn−1. To illustrate this idea, Gous (1999) split a book (Machiavelli’s The
Prince) into several text blocks (its numbered pages), considered each page as a
point in P|V |−1, and projected data into a 2-dimensional submanifold. The result is

the representation of the book as a sequential path in R2, tracking the evolution of
the subject matter of the book over the course of its pages (see Fig. 5). Inspired by

Figure 5: The 113 pages of The Prince projected onto a 2-dimensional space (ex-
tracted from (Gous, 1999)). The inﬂection around page 85 reﬂects a real change in
the subject matter, where the book shifts from political theory to a more biograph-
ical discourse.

this framework, Lebanon et al. (2007) suggested representing a document as a sim-
plicial curve (i.e. a curve in the probability simplex), yielding the locally weighted
bag-of-words (lowbow) model. According to this representation, a length-normalized
document is a function x : [0, 1] × V → R+ such that

x(t, wj) = 1,

for any t ∈ [0, 1].

(9)

(cid:88)

wj∈V

We can regard the document as a continuous signal, and x(t, wj) as expressing
the relevance of word wj at instant t. This generalizes both the pure sequential
representation and the (global) bag-of-words model. Let y = (y1, . . . , yn) ∈ V n be
a n-length document. The pure sequential representation of y arises by deﬁning
x = xseq with:

(10)
where (cid:100)a(cid:101) denotes the smallest integer greater than a. The global bag-of-words
representation of x corresponds to deﬁning x = xbow, where

xseq(t, wj) =

0,

if wj = y(cid:100)tn(cid:101)
if wj (cid:54)= y(cid:100)tn(cid:101),

(cid:26) 1,

xbow(µ, wj) =

xseq(t, wj)dt, µ ∈ [0, 1], j = 1, . . . ,|V |.

(11)

In this case, the curve degenerates into a single point in the simplex, which is
the maximum likelihood estimate of the multinomial parameters. An intermediate

(cid:90) 1

representation arises by smoothing (10) via a function fµ,σ : [0, 1] → R++, where
µ ∈ [0, 1] and σ ∈ R++ are respectively a location and a scale parameter. An
example of such a smoothing function is the truncated Gaussian deﬁned in [0, 1]
and normalized. This allows deﬁning the lowbow representation at µ of the n-lenght
document (y1, . . . , yn) ∈ V n as the function x : [0, 1] × V → R+ such that:

x(µ, wj) =

xseq(t, wj)fµ,σ(t)dt.

(12)

0

The scale of the smoothing function controls the amount of locality/globality in
the document representation (see Fig. 6): when σ → ∞ we recover the global bow
representation (11); when σ → 0, we approach the pure sequential representation
(10).

of the scale parameter σ (extracted from (Lebanon, 2006)).

Representing a document as a simplicial curve allows us to characterize geomet-
rically several properties of the document. For example, the tangent vector ﬁeld
along the curve describes sequential “topic trends” and their change; the curvature
measures the amount of wigglyness or deviation from a geodesic path. This prop-
erties can be useful for tasks like text segmentation or summarization; for example
plotting the velocity of the curve || ˙x(µ)|| along time oﬀers a visualization of the doc-
ument where local maxima tend to correspond to topic boundaries (see (Lebanon
et al., 2007) for more information).

5 Evaluation

Evaluating a summary is a diﬃcult task because there does not exist an ideal sum-
mary for a given document or set of documents. From papers surveyed in the previ-
ous sections and elsewhere in literature, it has been found that agreement between
human summarizers is quite low, both for evaluating and generating summaries.
More than the form of the summary, it is diﬃcult to evaluate the summary con-
tent. Another important problem in summary evaluation is the widespread use of
disparate metrics. The absence of a standard human or automatic evaluation met-
ric makes it very hard to compare diﬀerent systems and establish a baseline. This
problem is not present in other NLP problems, like parsing. Besides this, manual
evaluation is too expensive: as stated by Lin (2004), large scale manual evaluation
of summaries as in the DUC conferences would require over 3000 hours of human ef-
forts. Hence, an evaluation metric having high correlation with human scores would
obviate the process of manual evaluation. In this section, we would look at some im-
portant recent papers that have been able to create standards in the summarization
community.

5.1 Human and Automatic Evaluation

Lin and Hovy (2002) describe and compare various human and automatic metrics to
evaluate summaries. They focus on the evaluation procedure used in the Document
Understanding Conference 2001 (DUC-2001), where the Summary Evaluation En-
vironment (SEE) interface was used to support the human evaluation part. NIST
assessors in DUC-2001 compared manually written ideal summaries with summaries
generated automatically by summarization systems and baseline summaries. Each
text was decomposed into a list of units (sentences) and displayed in separate win-
dows in SEE. To measure the content of summaries, assessors stepped through each
model unit (MU) from the ideal summaries and marked all system units (SU) shar-
ing content with the current model unit, rating them with scores in the range 1 − 4
to specify that the marked system units express all (4), most (3), some (2) or hardly
any (1) of the content of the current model unit. Grammaticality, cohesion, and co-
herence were also rated similarly by the assessors. The weighted recall at threshold
t (where t range from 1 to 4) is then deﬁned as

Recallt =

Number of MUs marked at or above t
Number of MUs in the model summary .

(13)

An interesting study is presented that shows how unstable the human markings
for overlapping units are. For multiple systems, the coverage scores assigned to the
same units were diﬀerent by human assessors 18% of the time for the single document
task and 7.6% of the time for multi-document task. The authors also observe that
inter-human agreement is quite low in creating extracts from documents (∼ 40% for
single-documents and ∼ 29% for multi-documents). To overcome the instability of
human evaluations, they proposed using automatic metrics for summary evaluation.

23

Inspired by the machine translation evaluation metric BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001),
they outline an accumulative n-gram matching score (which they call NAMS),

NAMS = a1 · NAM1 + a2 · NAM2 + a3 · NAM3 + a4 · NAM4,

where the NAMn n-gram hit ratio is deﬁned as:

# of matched n-grams between MU and S

total # of n-grams in MU

(14)

(15)

with S denoting here the whole system summary, and where only content words
were used in forming the n-grams. Diﬀerent conﬁgurations of ai were tried; the
best correlation with human judgement (using Spearman’s rank order correlation
coeﬃcient) was achieved using a conﬁguration giving 2/3 weight to bigram matches
and 1/3 to unigrams matches with stemming done by the Porter stemmer.

5.2 ROUGE

Lin (2004) introduced a set of metrics called Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gist-
ing Evaluation (ROUGE)23 that have become standards of automatic evaluation of
summaries.
In what follows, let R = {r1, . . . , rm} be a set of reference summaries, and let s be
a summary generated automatically by some system. Let Φn(d) be a binary vector
representing the n-grams contained in a document d; the i-th component φi
n(d) is 1
if the i-th n-gram is contained in d and 0 otherwise. The metric ROUGE-N is an
n-gram recall based statistic that can be computed as follows:

ROUGE-N(s) =

(16)
where (cid:104)., .(cid:105) denotes the usual inner product of vectors. This measure is closely related
to BLEU which is a precision related measure. Unlike other measures previously
considered, ROUGE-N can be used for multiple reference summaries, which is quite
useful in practical situations. An alternative is taking the most similar summary in
the reference set,

ROUGE-Nmulti(s) = max
r∈R

(cid:104)Φn(r), Φn(s)(cid:105)
(cid:104)Φn(r), Φn(r)(cid:105) .

(17)

Another metric in (Lin, 2004) applies the concept of longest common subse-
quences 24 (LCS). The rationale is: the longer the LCS between two summary sen-
tences, the more similar they are. Let r1, . . . , ru be the reference sentences of the
documents in R, and s a candidate summary (considered as a concatenation of
sentences). The ROUGE-L is deﬁned as an LCS based F-measure:

ROUGE-L(s) =

(1 + β2)RLCSPLCS
RLCS + β2PLCS

(18)

23See http://openrouge.com/default.aspx.
24A subsequence of a string s = s1 . . . sn is a string of the form si1 . . . sin where 1 ≤ i1 < . . . in ≤ n.

, PLCS(s) =

, |x| denotes the length of
where RLCS(s) =
sentence x, LCS(x, y) denotes the length of the LCS between sentences x and y,
and β is a (usually large) parameter to balance precision and recall. Notice that
the LCS function may be computed by a simple dynamic programming approach.
The metric (18) is further reﬁned by including weights that penalize subsequence
matches that are not consecutive, yielding a new measure denoted ROUGE-W.

i=1 LCS(ri,s)

|s|

Yet another measure introduced by Lin (2004) is ROUGE-S, which can be seen
as a gappy version of ROUGE-N for n = 2 and is aptly called skip bigram. Let Ψ2(d)
be a binary vector indexed by ordered pairs of words; the i-th component ψi
2(d) is
1 if the i-th pair is a subsequence of d and 0 otherwise. The metric ROUGE-S is
computed as follows:

where RS(s) =

ROUGE-S(s) =

Pu
Pu
i=1(cid:104)Ψ2(ri),Ψ2(s)(cid:105)
i=1(cid:104)Ψ2(ri),Ψ2(ri)(cid:105) and PS(s) =

(1 + β2)RSPS
RS + β2PS

Pu
i=1(cid:104)Ψ2(ri),Ψ2(s)(cid:105)
(cid:104)Ψ2(s),Ψ2(s)(cid:105)

(19)

.

The various versions of ROUGE were evaluated by computing the correlation
coeﬃcient between ROUGE scores and human judgement scores. ROUGE-2 per-
formed the best among the ROUGE-N variants. ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, and
ROUGE-S all performed very well on the DUC-2001 and DUC-2002 datasets. How-
ever, correlation achieved with human judgement for multi-document summarization
was not as high as single-document ones; improvement on this side of the paradigm
is an open research topic.

5.3 Information-theoretic Evaluation of Summaries

A very recent approach (Lin et al., 2006) proposes to use an information-theoretic
method to automatic evaluation of summaries. The central idea is to use a diver-
gence measure between a pair of probability distributions, in this case the Jensen-
Shannon divergence, where the ﬁrst distribution is derived from an automatic sum-
mary and the second from a set of reference summaries. This approach has the
advantage of suiting both the single-document and the multi-document summariza-
tion scenarios.
Let D = {d1, . . . , dn} be the set of documents to summarize (which is a singleton
set in the case of single-document summarization). Assume that a distribution
parameterized by θR generates reference summaries of the documents in D. The
task of summarization can be seen as that of estimating θR. Analogously, assume
that every summarization system is governed by some distribution parameterized
by θA. Then, we may deﬁne a good summarizer as one for which θA is close to θR.
One information-theoretic measure between distributions that is adequate for this
is the KL divergence (Cover and Thomas, 1991),

KL(pθA||pθR) =

pθA
i

log pθA
i
pθR
i

.

(20)

m(cid:88)

i=1

However, the KL divergence is unbounded and goes to inﬁnity whenever pθA

i vanishes

25

and pθR
i does not, which requires using some kind of smoothing when estimating the
distributions. Lin et al. (2006) claims that the measure used here should also be
symmetric,25 another thing that the KL divergence is not. Hence, they propose to
use the Jensen-Shannon divergence which is bounded and symmetric:26

JS(pθA||pθR) =

1
2 KL(pθA||r) +

1
2 KL(pθR||r) =
2 H(pθA),

2 H(pθA) − 1

= H(r) − 1

(21)

where r = 1

2 pθA + 1

2 pθR is the average distribution.

To evaluate a summary SA given a reference summary SR, the authors propose
to use the negative JS divergence between the estimates of pθA and pθR given the
summaries,

score(SA|SR) = −JS(p

ˆθA||p

ˆθR)

The parameters are estimated via a posteriori maximization assuming a multi-
nomial generation model for each summary (which means that they are modeled as
bags-of-words) and using Dirichlet priors (the conjugate priors of the multinomial
family). So:

the summary, a0 =(cid:80)m

i=1 ai)

where (m being the number of distinct words, a1, . . . , am being the word counts in

ˆθA = arg max
θA

p(SA|θA)p(θA),

p(SA|θA) =

Γ(a0 + 1)
i=1 Γ(ai + 1)

(cid:81)m
(cid:81)m

m(cid:89)

i=1

and

Γ(α0)
i=1 Γ(αi)

p(θA) =

where αi are hyper-parameters and α0 =(cid:80)m
ˆθA,i = ai + αi − 1
a0 + α0 − m

i=1

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

i=1 αi. After some algebra, we get

which is similar to MLE with smoothing.27 ˆθR is estimated analogously using the
reference summary SR. Not surprisingly, if we have more than one reference sum-
mary, the MAP estimation given all summaries equals MAP estimation given their
concatenation into a single summary.

25However, the authors do not give much support for this claim. In our view, there is no reason

to require symmetry.

26Although this is not mentioned in (Lin et al., 2006), the Jensen-Shannon divergence also satisﬁes
the axioms to be a squared metric, as shown by Endres and Schindelin (2003). It has also a plethora
of properties that are presented elsewhere, but this is out of scope of this survey.

27In particular if αi = 1 it is just maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).

26

The authors experimented three automatic evaluation schemes (JS with smooth-
ing, JS without smoothing, and KL divergence) against manual evaluation; the best
performance was achieved by JS without smoothing. This is not surprising since, as
seen above, the JS divergence is bounded, unlike the KL divergence, and so it does
not require smoothing. Smoothing has the eﬀect of pulling the two distributions
more close to the uniform distribution.

6 Conclusion

The rate of information growth due to the World Wide Web has called for a need
to develop eﬃcient and accurate summarization systems. Although research on
summarization started about 50 years ago, there is still a long trail to walk in
this ﬁeld. Over time, attention has drifted from summarizing scientiﬁc articles to
news articles, electronic mail messages, advertisements, and blogs. Both abstractive
and extractive approaches have been attempted, depending on the application at
hand. Usually, abstractive summarization requires heavy machinery for language
generation and is diﬃcult to replicate or extend to broader domains. In contrast,
simple extraction of sentences have produced satisfactory results in large-scale ap-
plications, specially in multi-document summarization. The recent popularity of
eﬀective newswire summarization systems conﬁrms this claim.

This survey emphasizes extractive approaches to summarization using statisti-
cal methods. A distinction has been made between single document and multi-
document summarization. Since a lot of interesting work is being done far from
the mainstream research in this ﬁeld, we have chosen to include a brief discussion
on some methods that we found relevant to future research, even if they focus only
on small details related to a general summarization process and not on building an
entire summarization system.

Finally, some recent trends in automatic evaluation of summarization systems
have been surveyed. The low inter-annotator agreement ﬁgures observed during
manual evaluations suggest that the future of this research area heavily depends on
the ability to ﬁnd eﬃcient ways of automatically evaluating these systems and on
the development of measures that are objective enough to be commonly accepted
by the research community.
