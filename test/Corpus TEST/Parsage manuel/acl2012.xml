    <abstract>We present an approach for detecting salient
(important) dates in texts in order to auto-
matically build event timelines from a search
query (e.g. the name of an event or person,
etc.). This work was carried out on a corpus
of newswire texts in English provided by the
Agence France Presse (AFP). In order to ex-
tract salient dates that warrant inclusion in an
event timeline, we first recognize and normal-
ize temporal expressions in texts and then use
a machine-learning approach to extract salient
dates that relate to a particular topic. We fo-
cused only on extracting the dates and not the
events to which they are related.</abstract>
    <introduction>Our aim here was to build thematic timelines for
a general domain topic defined by a user query.
This task, which involves the extraction of important
events, is related to the tasks of Retrospective Event
Detection (Yang et al., 1998), or New Event Detec-
tion, as defined for example in Topic Detection and
Tracking (TDT) campaigns (Allan, 2002).
The majority of systems designed to tackle this
task make use of textual information in a bag-of-
words manner.
They use little temporal informa-
tion, generally only using document metadata, such
as the document creation time (DCT). The few sys-
tems that do make use of temporal information (such
as the now discontinued Google timeline), only ex-
tract absolute, full dates (that feature a day, month
and year). In our corpus, described in Section 3.1,
we found that only 7% of extracted temporal expres-
sions are absolute dates.
We distinguish our work from that of previous re-
searchers in that we have focused primarily on ex-
tracted temporal information as opposed to other
textual content. We show that using linguistic tem-
poral processing helps extract important events in
texts. Our system extracts a maximum of temporal
information and uses only this information to detect
salient dates for the construction of event timelines.
Other types of content are used for initial thematic
document retrieval. Output is a list of dates, ranked
from most important to least important with respect
to the given topic. Each date is presented with a set
of relevant sentences.
We can see this work as a new, easily evaluable
task of “date extraction”, which is an important com-
ponent of timeline summarization.
In what follows, we first review some of the re-
lated work in Section 2. Section 3 presents the re-
sources used and gives an overview of the system.
The system used for temporal analysis is described
in Section 4, and the strategy used for indexing and
finding salient dates, as well as the results obtained,
are given in Section 51.

Research Agency (ANR) under project Chronolines (ANR-10-
CORD-010). We would like to thank the French News Agency
(AFP) for providing us with the corpus.</introduction>
   
    <discussion>Discussion and Final Experiment
Chronologies hand-written by journalists are a very
useful resources for evaluation of our system, as they
are completely dissociated from our research and are
an exact representation of the output we aim to ob-
tain. However, assembling such a chronology is a
very subjective task, and no clear method for evalu-
ation agreement between two journalists seems im-
mediately apparent.
Only experts can build such
chronologies, and calculating this agreement would
require at least two experts from each domain, which
are hard to come by. One may then consider our sys-
tem as a useful tool for building a chronology more
objectively.
To illustrate this point, we chose four specific top-
ics6 and showed one of our runs on each topic to an
AFP expert for these subjects. We asked him to as-
sess the first 30 dates of these runs.
6Namely, “Arab revolt timeline for Morocco”, “Kyrgyzs-
tan unrest timeline”, “Lebanon’s new government: a timeline”,
“Libya timeline”.

Table 4: Average precision results for manual evaluation
on 4 topics, against the original chronologies (APC), and
the expert assessment (APE).
Table 4 presents results for this evaluation, com-
paring average precision values obtained 1) against
the original, manual chronologies (APC), and 2)
against the expert assessment (APE). These values
show that, for 3 runs out of 4, many dates returned
by the system are considered as valid by the expert,
even if not presented in the original chronology.
Even if this experiment is not strong enough to
lead to a formal conclusion (post-hoc evaluation
with only 4 topics and a single assessor), this tends
to show that our system produces usable outputs and
that our system can be of help to journalists by pro-
viding them with chronologies that are as useful and
objective as possible.

    <conclusion>Conclusion and Future Work
This article presents a task of “date extraction” and
shows the importance of taking temporal informa-
tion into consideration and how with relatively sim-
ple temporal processing, we were able to indirectly
point to important events using the temporal infor-
mation associated with these events. Of course, as
our final goal consists in the detection of important
events, we need to take into account the textual con-
tent. In future work, we envisage providing, together
with the detection of salient dates, a semantic analy-
sis that will help determine the importance of events.
Another interesting direction in which we soon aim
to work is to consider all textual excerpts that are as-
sociated with salient dates, and use clustering tech-
niques to determine if textual excerpts correspond to
the same event or not. Finally, as our news corpus
is available both for English and French (compara-
ble corpus, not necessarily translations), we aim to
investigate cross-lingual extraction of salient dates
and salient events.</conclusion>
