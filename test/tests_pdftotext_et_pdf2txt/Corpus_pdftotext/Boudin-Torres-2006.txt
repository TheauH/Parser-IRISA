Abstract

redundancy with previously read documents (history) has to be removed from the extract.
A natural way to go about update summarization
would be extracting temporal tags (dates, elapsed
times, temporal expressions...) (Mani and Wilson,
2000) or to automatically construct the timeline
from documents (Swan and Allan, 2000). These
temporal marks could be used to focus extracts on
the most recently written facts. However, most recently written facts are not necessarily new facts.
Machine Reading (MR) was used by (Hickl et
al., 2007) to construct knowledge representations
from clusters of documents. Sentences containing “new” information (i.e. that could not be inferred by any previously considered document)
are selected to generate summary. However, this
highly efficient approach (best system in DUC
2007 update) requires large linguistic resources.
(Witte et al., 2007) propose a rule-based system
based on fuzzy coreference cluster graphs. Again,
this approach requires to manually write the sentence ranking scheme. Several strategies remaining on post-processing redundancy removal techniques have been suggested. Extracts constructed
from history were used by (Boudin and TorresMoreno, 2007) to minimize history’s redundancy.
(Lin et al., 2007) have proposed a modified Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) (Carbonell and
Goldstein, 1998) re-ranker during sentence selection, constructing the summary by incrementally
re-ranking sentences.
In this paper, we propose a scalable sentence
scoring method for update summarization derived
from MMR. Motivated by the need for relevant
novelty, candidate sentences are selected according to a combined criterion of query relevance and
dissimilarity with previously read sentences. The
rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2

We present S MMR, a scalable sentence
scoring method for query-oriented update summarization. Sentences are scored
thanks to a criterion combining query relevance and dissimilarity with already read
documents (history). As the amount of
data in history increases, non-redundancy
is prioritized over query-relevance. We
show that S MMR achieves promising results on the DUC 2007 update corpus.

Introduction

Extensive experiments on query-oriented multidocument summarization have been carried out
over the past few years. Most of the strategies
to produce summaries are based on an extraction method, which identifies salient textual segments, most often sentences, in documents. Sentences containing the most salient concepts are selected, ordered and assembled according to their
relevance to produce summaries (also called extracts) (Mani and Maybury, 1999).
Recently emerged from the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) 20071 , update summarization attempts to enhance summarization
when more information about knowledge acquired
by the user is available. It asks the following question: has the user already read documents on the
topic? In the case of a positive answer, producing
an extract focusing on only new facts is of interest. In this way, an important issue is introduced:

where S 0 is the term set of s in which the terms
m that already have maximized J W(q, m) are removed. The use of J We smooths normalization and
misspelling errors. Each sentence s is scored using
the linear combination:

q∈Q

Method

The underlying idea of our method is that as the
number of sentences in the history increases, the
likelihood to have redundant information within
candidate sentences also increases. We propose
a scalable sentence scoring method derived from
MMR that, as the size of the history increases,
gives more importance to non-redundancy that to
query relevance. We define H to represent the previously read documents (history), Q to represent
the query and s the candidate sentence. The following subsections formally define the similarity
measures and the scalable MMR scoring method.
2.1

(1)

~
Sim1 (s, Q) = α · cosine(~s, Q)
+ (1 − α) · J We (s, Q)

(2)

where α = 0.7, optimally tuned on the past DUCs
data (2005 and 2006). The system produces a list
of ranked sentences from which the summary is
constructed by arranging the high scored sentences
until the desired size is reached.
2.2

A scalable MMR approach

MMR re-ranking algorithm has been successfully
used in query-oriented summarization (Ye et al.,
2005). It strives to reduce redundancy while maintaining query relevance in selected sentences. The
summary is constructed incrementally from a list
of ranked sentences, at each iteration the sentence
which maximizes MMR is chosen:

A query-oriented multi-document
summarizer

We have first started by implementing a simple
summarizer for which the task is to produce queryfocused summaries from clusters of documents.
Each document is pre-processed: documents are
segmented into sentences, sentences are filtered
(words which do not carry meaning are removed
such as functional words or common words) and
normalized using a lemmas database (i.e. inflected
forms “go”, “goes”, “went”, “gone”... are replaced
by “go”). An N -dimensional term-space Γ , where
N is the number of different terms found in the
cluster, is constructed. Sentences are represented
in Γ by vectors in which each component is the
term frequency within the sentence. Sentence scoring can be seen as a passage retrieval task in Information Retrieval (IR). Each sentence s is scored by
computing a combination of two similarity measures between the sentence and the query. The first
measure is the well known cosine angle (Salton et
al., 1975) between the sentence and the query vectorial representations in Γ (denoted respectively ~s
~ The second similarity measure is based
and Q).
on the Jaro-Winkler distance (Winkler, 1999). The
original Jaro-Winkler measure, denoted J W, uses
the number of matching characters and transpositions to compute a similarity score between two
terms, giving more favourable ratings to terms that
match from the beginning. We have extended this
measure to calculate the similarity between the

MMR = arg max [ λ · Sim1 (s, Q)
s∈S

− (1 − λ) · max Sim2 (s, sj ) ]
sj ∈E

(3)

where S is the set of candidates sentences and E
is the set of selected sentences. λ represents an
interpolation coefficient between sentence’s relevance and non-redundancy. Sim2 (s, sj ) is a normalized Longest Common Substring (LCS) measure between sentences s and sj . Detecting sentence rehearsals, LCS is well adapted for redundancy removal.
We propose an interpretation of MMR to tackle
the update summarization issue. Since Sim1 and
Sim2 are ranged in [0, 1], they can be seen as probabilities even though they are not. Just as rewriting
(3) as (NR stands for Novelty Relevance):
NR = arg max [ λ · Sim1 (s, Q)
s∈S

+ (1 − λ) · (1 − max Sim2 (s, sh )) ] (4)
sh ∈H

We can understand that (4) equates to an OR combination. But as we are looking for a more intuitive AND and since the similarities are independent, we have to use the product combination. The

scoring method defined in (2) is modified into a
double maximization criterion in which the best
ranked sentence will be the most relevant to the
query AND the most different to the sentences in
H.

Within a topic, the document clusters must be processed in chronological order. Our system generates a summary for each cluster by arranging the
high ranked sentences until the limit of 100 words
is reached.

S MMR(s) = Sim1 (s, Q)

f (H)
· 1 − max Sim2 (s, sh )
(5)
sh ∈H

3.2

Decreasing λ in (3) with the length of the summary was suggested by (Murray et al., 2005) and
successfully used in the DUC 2005 by (Hachey
et al., 2005), thereby emphasizing the relevance
at the outset but increasingly prioritizing redundancy removal as the process continues. Similarly, we propose to follow this assumption in
S MMR using a function denoted f that as the
amount of data in history increases, prioritize nonredundancy (f (H) → 0).

Most existing automated evaluation methods work
by comparing the generated summaries to one or
more reference summaries (ideally, produced by
humans). To evaluate the quality of our generated
summaries, we choose to use the ROUGE3 (Lin,
2004) evaluation toolkit, that has been found to be
highly correlated with human judgments. ROUGE N is a n-gram recall measure calculated between
a candidate summary and a set of reference summaries. In our experiments ROUGE -1, ROUGE -2
and ROUGE - SU 4 will be computed.

Experiments

The method described in the previous section has
been implemented and evaluated by using the
DUC 2007 update corpus2 . The following subsections present details of the different experiments
we have conducted.

Results

Table 1 reports the results obtained on the DUC
2007 update data set for different sentence scoring methods. cosine + J We stands for the scoring method defined in (2) and NR improves it
with sentence re-ranking defined in equation (4).
S MMR is the combined adaptation we have proposed in (5). The function f (H) used in S MMR is
the simple rational function H1 , where H increases
with the number of previous clusters (f (H) = 1
for cluster A, 12 for cluster B and 31 for cluster C).
This function allows to simply test the assumption
that non-redundancy have to be favoured as the
size of history grows. Baseline results are obtained
on summaries generated by taking the leading sentences of the most recent documents of the cluster,
up to 100 words (official baseline of DUC). The
table also lists the three top performing systems at
DUC 2007 and the lowest scored human reference.
As we can see from these results, S MMR outperforms the other sentence scoring methods. By
ways of comparison our system would have been
ranked second at the DUC 2007 update competition. Moreover, no post-processing was applied to
the selected sentences leaving an important margin
of progress. Another interesting result is the high
performance of the non-update specific method
(cosine + J We ) that could be due to the small size

The DUC 2007 update corpus

We used for our experiments the DUC 2007 update competition data set. The corpus is composed
of 10 topics, with 25 documents per topic. The update task goal was to produce short (∼100 words)
multi-document update summaries of newswire articles under the assumption that the user has already read a set of earlier articles. The purpose
of each update summary will be to inform the
reader of new information about a particular topic.
Given a DUC topic and its 3 document clusters: A
(10 documents), B (8 documents) and C (7 documents), the task is to create from the documents
three brief, fluent summaries that contribute to satisfying the information need expressed in the topic
statement.
1. A summary of documents in cluster A.
2. An update summary of documents in B, under the assumption that the reader has already
read documents in A.

In this paper we have described S MMR, a scalable sentence scoring method based on MMR that
achieves very promising results. An important aspect of our sentence scoring method is that it does
not requires re-ranking nor linguistic knowledge,
which makes it a simple and fast approach to the
issue of update summarization. It was pointed out
at the DUC 2007 workshop that Question Answering and query-oriented summarization have been
converging on a common task. The value added
by summarization lies in the linguistic quality. Approaches mixing IR techniques are well suited for
query-oriented summarization but they require intensive work for making the summary fluent and
coherent. Among the others, this is a point that we
think is worthy of further investigation.
