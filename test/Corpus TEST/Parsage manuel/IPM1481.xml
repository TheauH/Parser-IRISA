    <abstract>The evolution of the job market has resulted in traditional methods of recruitment becom-
ing insufficient. As it is now necessary to handle volumes of information (mostly in the
form of free text) that are impossible to process manually, an analysis and assisted catego-
rization are essential to address this issue. In this paper, we present a combination of the
E-Gen and CORTEX systems. E-Gen aims to perform analysis and categorization of job offers
together with the responses given by the candidates. E-Gen system strategy is based on
vectorial and probabilistic models to solve the problem of profiling applications according
to a specific job offer. CORTEX is a statistical automatic summarization system. In this work,
E-Gen uses Cortex as a powerful filter to eliminate irrelevant information contained in
candidate answers. Our main objective is to develop a system to assist a recruitment
consultant and the results obtained by the proposed combination surpass those of E-Gen
in standalone mode on this task.</abstract>
    <introduction>1. Introduction
The evolution of the job market has resulted in that traditional methods of recruitment becoming insufficient. The
Internet has introduced a new way of managing human resources. Theoretically, shifting job search and recruitment activ-
ities to the Internet improves the quality of job matching by reducing search costs, increasing contact opportunities and
rationalizing the screening process of job applicants (Marchal, Mellet, & Rieucau, 2007). Over the last few years, there has
been a significant expansion of online recruitment (e.g. August 2003: 177,000 job offers, May 2008: 500,000 job offers).1
The Internet has become essential in this process because it allows a better flow of information, either through job search
sites or by e-mail exchanges. Nowadays, job seekers can send their curriculum vitae (CV) directly to companies (by e-mail
or uploaded to dedicated servers on the Web). The job search task is becoming easier and less time consuming. The Internet
makes every user a potential job seeker. Employees may be constantly in search of new career opportunities and job candi-
dates may provide more interaction than can be managed efficiently by companies (Bourse, LeclFre, Morin, &amp; Trichet, 2004).
As intellectual capital has become one of the most strategic assets of successful organizations in the last decade, the capa-
bility of managing people’s expertise, skills and experience represents a key factor in facing up to the increasing competitive-
ness of the global market (Colucci et al., 2003). Even though a browser has become a universal and easy tool for users, they

frequently have to enter data into Web forms from paper sources and the need to ‘‘copy and paste’’ data between different
applications is symptomatic of the issues of data integration. In this context, electronic recruitment tends to automate match-
ing between the published information about the candidates and job offers. The Laboratoire Informatique d’Avignon (LIA),2 the
Laboratoire d’Informatique, de Robotique et de Microélectronique de Montpellier(LIRMM),3 and Aktor Interactive4 are developing
the E-Gen system to resolve this issue. E-Gen is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) system
composed of three main modules:
1. The first one extracts the information from a corpus of e-mails of job offers from Aktor’s database.
2. The second module analyses the candidate’s answers (i.e. splitting e-mails into cover letter (CL) and curriculum vitae).
3. The third module analyses and computes a relevant ranking of the candidate’s answers.
Our first work (Kessler, Torres-Moreno, & El-Bèze, 2007) presented the first module: the identification of different parts
of a job offer and the extraction of relevant information (type of contract, salary, localization, etc.). The second module
analyses the content of a candidate’s e-mail, using a combination of rules and machine learning methods (Support Vector
Machines, SVM) and was presented in Kessler, Torres-Moreno, and El-Bèze (2008b). Furthermore, it separates the distinct
parts of CV and CL with a precision of 0.98 and a recall of 0.96. Reading a large number of candidate answers for a job is a
very time consuming task for a recruiting consultant. In order to facilitate this task, we propose a system capable of pro-
viding an initial evaluation of candidate answers according to various criteria. We do not seek the best or even a good can-
didate as no scoring is involved, but simply a candidate who has a close application to those already selected. Our previous
work (Kessler, Béchet, Roche, El-Bèze, & Torres-Moreno, 2009) presented an approach based on a process of relevance feed-
back, permitting a reinforcement learning (Sutton & Barto, 1998). In this paper, we present an original combination of the
E-Gen and CORTEX systems. Each document contains a number of additional information, present in many applications and
which is partially removed by classical pre-processing. Each application added by the process of relevance feedback adds
relevant information but also multiplies additional information. CORTEX allows us to filter these sentences and keep only the
most relevant sentences at the evaluation step. Some related studies are briefly discussed in Section 2. Section 3 shows a
general system overview. In Section 4, we describe the E-Gen pre-processing task, the strategy used to rank the candidate
answers with relevance feedback and the coupling of E-Gen with the CORTEX summarization system. In Section 5, we present
statistics about the textual corpus, experimental protocol, an example of CL summary generated by CORTEX, and several
results.</introduction>
<results>5.3. Results
In this section, we present the results obtained by combining the CORTEX system with the E-Gen ranking application. CORTEX was used as an additional filter which generates a summary of each document before E-Gen evaluation. We keep the struc- ture of data for job offers as described in Kessler et al. (2008a). A job offer is composed of a Description (D), a Title (T), a Mission (M), and a Profile (P). For these experiments, we use two combinations of a job offer content, keeping only Title, Mis- sion, Profile (TMP) and all information of a job offer (DTMP). Results are presented in Tables 2 and 3. Each column presents a part of the application with different sizes of summaries for each line (75%, 50%, . . ., 5%). Full text is a result obtained with 100% of the document and was published previously in Kessler et al. (2008a, 2009).
Table 2 presents results obtained for each part of the application separately. We observe that AUC of CVs remains below the baseline whatever the percentage of compression. We notice however a gradual decrease in AUC scores depending on the percentage of compression. We explain this by the fact that a CV is already a summary of the most important information about the candidates and thereby attempting to summarize degrades final results. We apply the same process with cover letters. Performance is still low overall for CLs in comparison with CVs, however, there is a slight increase in AUC scores with a compression rate of 30%. We explain these results by particular information contained in a cover letter such as the form of address at the beginning or end of the letter (see Fig. 4) which are noise for the ranking system of E-Gen. Results with TMP segmentation (i.e. conserving only Title, Mission, and Profile of job offer) are of better quality.
Table 3 presents the results obtained by combining both parts of the application. Full text values are computed with the whole documents of the application. The first two columns show the results obtained by combining the summary of the CV and the CL. We observe again a deterioration in the results when trying to summarize the CV. Even if results are lower, it should be noted, however, that the best score is again obtained at 30%. The last two columns present the results with a sum- marized CL and the full CV. We observe an overall improvement of the AUC score and the best results with a compression rate of 30% of the Cover Letter.
Next step is to combine summaries of the cover letter, which suppresses noise and enriches the offer with the Relevance Feedback process. Table 4 presents the results obtained with different sizes of Relevance Feedback (RF1 corresponds to one application added to the job offer, RF2 two applications added to the job offer, etc.). Each application added with the rele- vance feedback process consists in a full CV and a summary of the cover letter with a compression rate of 30%. A random distribution of applications produces an AUC approximately at 0.5 like explained in Fawcett (2006). We compare ISMIS Result with those obtained using a summary of the cover letter. Each test is carried out 100 times with a random distribution of relevant applications for Relevance Feedback. Then we compute an average of AUC scores obtained (the curve shows the

average for each size). In fact, we compute the Residual Ranking (Billerbeck & Zobel, 2006): Documents that are used for Rel- evance Feedback are removed from the collection before ranking with the reformulated query. We assume that the Rele- vance Feedback process would behave as a reinforcement learning (Sutton & Barto, 1998) but it is impossible to experiment RFn with n > 6 with this corpus because the number of relevant candidates is too small for some job offers (see Table 1). We observe a slight improvement in results for almost any size of Relevance Feedback. We are conscious that the performance gain is low, however, it confirms previous results on the Cover Letter. Fig. 5 shows this improvement. This figure confirms that the addition of just one relevant candidate (RF1) enables the AUC value to be enhanced (i.e. an improve- ment of 0.5–1.2%). This Relevance Feedback (i.e. RF1) is not very time-consuming for the expert.
Fig. 6 shows detailed results of one test. For clarity reasons, we present only 3 of the 12 jobs of our dataset in order to compare results with and without CORTEX (for each job, RFC are AUC scores with CORTEX and RF without CORTEX).
For standard system, we observe a positive progress from 1% to 10% for 10 jobs between RF0 and RF1 (e.g. five jobs have an improvement between 5% and 10%). Note that between RF0 and RF6, 6 jobs have a significant positive progress between 10% and 12%. The combination of the E-Gen and CORTEX systems improve standard system results for five jobs from 1% to 5% between RF0 and RF1. Between RF0 and RF6, the Cortex version improves E-Gen’s results for eight jobs from 1% to 5%.
The study of the results shows that job offer 31702 contains some relevant applications with a bad labeling (CV are la- beled CL and CL are only a hyperlink to a CV). The reduction of information on the main document of the application leads the system version using summaries to degrade the AUC scores. Job offer 34861 shows a good improvement with each size of relevance feedback (RF0:0.65, RF1:0.70, RF6:0.73) and with CORTEX (RF0:0.68, RF1:0.72, RF6:0.79). The detailed study of re- sults shows that job offer 33746 contains some empty applications labeled relevant. This leads the system with and without CORTEX to degrade final results. In the same way, an application added without CL explains the identical score in RF2 between RF and RFC for job offer 31274.</results>
    <conclusion>6. Conclusion and future work
Job offer processing is a difficult and highly subjective task. The retrieval of relevant information concerning job descrip- tions and skills is not a trivial task (Loth et al., 2010) and results on this type of document have been quite low (Clech &

Zighed, 2003). The information we use in this kind of process is not well formated in natural language, but follows a conven- tional structure. This paper deals with the CORTEX summarizer and the E-Gen system for processing job offers. E-Gen assists an employer in the recruitment task. This paper focuses on candidate answers to job offers. We rank the candidate answers by using different similarity measures and different document representations in a vector space model. We use a process of rel- evance feedback to perform reinforcement learning, whereby each new application added to the process assists in the deci- sion-making. We choose to evaluate the quality of our approaches by computing Area Under the Curve. CORTEX is a summarization system using an optimal decision algorithm that combines several metrics. We present the results obtained by combining both systems. AUC obtained with summarized cover letter at 30% of compression size and a full CV shows a slight improvement in the results. As future work, we plan to apply other techniques, such as finding discriminant features of irrelevant applications using the Rocchio algorithm (Rocchio, 1971), weighting the different parts of an application, etc. in order to improve results. We also plan to use a categorization of jobs to take into consideration similar jobs, such as ’’devel- oper’’ and ‘‘programmer’’. Finally we propose to measure the CV quality by building an evaluation on an Internet portal. Our aim with this evaluation is to present a job-seeker with a list of the most suitable job ads according to his profile.
