Abstract. Sentence Boundary Detection (SBD) has been a major
research topic since Automatic Speech Recognition transcripts have been
used for further Natural Language Processing tasks like Part of Speech
Tagging, Question Answering or Automatic Summarization. But what
about evaluation? Do standard evaluation metrics like precision, recall,
F-score or classiﬁcation error; and more important, evaluating an automatic system against a unique reference is enough to conclude how well
a SBD system is performing given the ﬁnal application of the transcript?
In this paper we propose Window-based Sentence Boundary Evaluation
(WiSeBE), a semi-supervised metric for evaluating Sentence Boundary
Detection systems based on multi-reference (dis)agreement. We evaluate and compare the performance of diﬀerent SBD systems over a set
of Youtube transcripts using WiSeBE and standard metrics. This double evaluation gives an understanding of how WiSeBE is a more reliable
metric for the SBD task.

Introduction

The goal of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is to transform spoken data
into a written representation, thus enabling natural human-machine interaction
[33] with further Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Machine translation, question answering, semantic parsing, POS tagging, sentiment analysis and
automatic text summarization; originally developed to work with formal written texts, can be applied over the transcripts made by ASR systems [2,25,31].
However, before applying any of these NLP tasks a segmentation process called
Sentence Boundary Detection (SBD) should be performed over ASR transcripts
to reach a minimal syntactic information in the text.
To measure the performance of a SBD system, the automatically segmented
transcript is evaluated against a single reference normally done by a human. But

given a transcript, does it exist a unique reference? Or, is it possible that the
same transcript could be segmented in ﬁve diﬀerent ways by ﬁve diﬀerent people
in the same conditions? If so, which one is correct; and more important, how
to fairly evaluate the automatically segmented transcript? These questions are
the foundations of Window-based Sentence Boundary Evaluation (WiSeBE), a
new semi-supervised metric for evaluating SBD systems based on multi-reference
(dis)agreement.
The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we set the frame of
SBD and how it is normally evaluated. WiSeBE is formally described in Sect. 3,
followed by a multi-reference evaluation in Sect. 4. Further analysis of WiSeBE
and discussion over the method and alternative multi-reference evaluation is
presented in Sect. 5. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the paper.

Sentence Boundary Detection

Sentence Boundary Detection (SBD) has been a major research topic science
ASR moved to more general domains as conversational speech [17,24,26]. Performance of ASR systems has improved over the years with the inclusion and
combination of new Deep Neural Networks methods [5,9,33]. As a general rule,
the output of ASR systems lacks of any syntactic information such as capitalization and sentence boundaries, showing the interest of ASR systems to obtain
the correct sequence of words with almost no concern of the overall structure of
the document [8].
Similar to SBD is the Punctuation Marks Disambiguation (PMD) or Sentence
Boundary Disambiguation. This task aims to segment a formal written text into
well formed sentences based on the existent punctuation marks [11,19,20,29]. In
this context a sentence is deﬁned (for English) by the Cambridge Dictionary1
as:
“a group of words, usually containing a verb, that expresses a thought in
the form of a statement, question, instruction, or exclamation and starts
with a capital letter when written”.
PMD carries certain complications, some given the ambiguity of punctuation
marks within a sentence. A period can denote an acronym, an abbreviation, the
end of the sentence or a combination of them as in the following example:
The U.S. president, Mr. Donald Trump, is meeting with the F.B.I.
director Christopher A. Wray next Thursday at 8 p.m.
However its diﬃculties, DPM proﬁts of morphological and lexical information
to achieve a correct sentence segmentation. By contrast, segmenting an ASR
transcript should be done without any (or almost any) lexical information and
a ﬂurry deﬁnition of sentence.

The obvious division in spoken language may be considered speaker utterances. However, in a normal conversation or even in a monologue, the way ideas
are organized diﬀers largely from written text. This diﬀerences, added to disﬂuencies like revisions, repetitions, restarts, interruptions and hesitations make the
deﬁnition of a sentence unclear thus complicating the segmentation task [27].
Table 1 exempliﬁes some of the diﬃculties that are present when working with
spoken language.

Stolcke and Shriberg [26] considered a set of linguistic structures as segments
including the following list:
–
–
–
–
–

Complete sentences
Stand-alone sentences
Disﬂuent sentences aborted in mid-utterance
Interjections
Back-channel responses.

In [17], Meteer and Iyer divided speaker utterances into segments, consisting
each of a single independent clause. A segment was considered to begin either
at the beginning of an utterance, or after the end of the preceding segment. Any
dysﬂuency between the end of the previous segments and the begging of current
one was considered part of the current segments.
Rott and Červa [23] aimed to summarize news delivered orally segmenting the
transcripts into “something that is similar to sentences”. They used a syntactic
analyzer to identify the phrases within the text.
A wide study focused in unbalanced data for the SBD task was performed
by Liu et al. [15]. During this study they followed the segmentation scheme proposed by the Linguistic Data Consortium2 on the Simple Metadata Annotation
Speciﬁcation V5.0 guideline (SimpleMDE V5.0) [27], dividing the transcripts in
Semantic Units.

A Semantic Unit (SU) is considered to be an atomic element of the transcript
that manages to express a complete thought or idea on the part of the speaker
[27]. Sometimes a SU corresponds to the equivalent of a sentence in written text,
but other times (the most part of them) a SU corresponds to a phrase or a single
word.
SUs seem to be an inclusive conception of a segment, they embrace diﬀerent
previous segment deﬁnitions and are ﬂexible enough to deal with the majority
of spoken language troubles. For these reasons we will adopt SUs as our segment
deﬁnition.
2.1

Sentence Boundary Evaluation

SBD research has been focused on two diﬀerent aspects; features and methods.
Regarding the features, some work focused on acoustic elements like pauses
duration, fundamental frequencies, energy, rate of speech, volume change and
speaker turn [10,12,14].
The other kind of features used in SBD are textual or lexical features. They
rely on the transcript content to extract features like bag-of-word, POS tags or
word embeddings [7,12,16,18,23,26,30]. Mixture of acoustic and lexical features
have also been explored [1,13,14,32], which is advantageous when both audio
signal and transcript are available.
With respect to the methods used for SBD, they mostly rely on statistical/neural machine translation [12,22], language models [8,15,18,26], conditional
random ﬁelds [16,30] and deep neural networks [3,7,29].
Despite their diﬀerences in features and/or methodology, almost all previous
cited research share a common element; the evaluation methodology. Metrics as
Precision, Recall, F1-score, Classiﬁcation Error Rate and Slot Error Rate (SER)
are used to evaluate the proposed system against one reference. As discussed
in Sect. 1, further NLP tasks rely on the result of SBD, meaning that is crucial
to have a good segmentation. But comparing the output of a system against a
unique reference will provide a reliable score to decide if the system is good or
bad?
Bohac et al. [1] compared the human ability to punctuate recognized spontaneous speech. They asked 10 people (correctors) to punctuate about 30 min of
ASR transcripts in Czech. For an average of 3,962 words, the punctuation marks
placed by correctors varied between 557 and 801; this means a diﬀerence of 244
segments for the same transcript. Over all correctors, the absolute consensus for
period (.) was only 4.6% caused by the replacement of other punctuation marks
as semicolons (;) and exclamation marks (!). These results are understandable if
we consider the diﬃculties presented previously in this section.
To our knowledge, the amount of studies that have tried to target the sentence
boundary evaluation with a multi-reference approach is very small. In [1], Bohac
et al. evaluated the overall punctuation accuracy for Czech in a straightforward
multi-reference framework. They considered a period (.) valid if at least ﬁve of
their 10 correctors agreed on its position.

Kolář and Lamel [13] considered two independent references to evaluate their
system and proposed two approaches. The ﬁst one was to calculate the SER for
each of one the two available references and then compute their mean. They
found this approach to be very strict because for those boundaries where no
agreement between references existed, the system was going to be partially wrong
even the fact that it has correctly predicted the boundary. Their second approach tried to moderate the number of unjust penalizations. For this case, a
classiﬁcation was considered incorrect only if it didn’t match either of the two
references.
These two examples exemplify the real need and some straightforward solutions for multi-reference evaluation metrics. However, we think that it is possible
to consider in a more inclusive approach the similarities and diﬀerences that multiple references could provide into a sentence boundary evaluation protocol.

Window-Based Sentence Boundary Evaluation

Window-Based Sentence Boundary Evaluation (WiSeBE) is a semi-automatic
multi-reference sentence boundary evaluation protocol which considers the performance of a candidate segmentation over a set of segmentation references and
the agreement between those references.
Let R = {R1 , R2 , ..., Rm } be the set of all available references given a transcript T = {t1 , t2 , ..., tn }, where tj is the j th word in the transcript; a reference
Ri is deﬁned as a binary vector in terms of the existent SU boundaries in T .
Ri = {b1 , b2 , ..., bn }


where
bj =

(1)

1 if tj is a boundary
0 otherwise

Given a transcript T , the candidate segmentation CT is deﬁned similar to Ri .
CT = {b1 , b2 , ..., bn }


where
bj =
3.1

(2)

1 if tj is a boundary
0 otherwise

General Reference and Agreement Ratio

A General Reference (RG ) is then constructed to calculate the agreement ratio
between all references in. It is deﬁned by the boundary frequencies of each reference Ri ∈ R.
RG = {d1 , d2 , ..., dn }
where

The Agreement Ratio (RGAR ) is needed to get a numerical value of the distribution of SU boundaries over R. A value of RGAR close to 0 means a low
agreement between references in R, while RGAR = 1 means a perfect agreement
(∀Ri ∈ R, Ri = Ri+1 |i = 1, ..., m − 1) in R.

Window-Boundaries Reference

In Sect. 2 we discussed about how disﬂuencies complicate SU segmentation. In a
multi-reference environment this causes disagreement between references around
a same SU boundary. The way WiSeBE handle disagreements produced by disﬂuencies is with a Window-boundaries Reference (RW ) deﬁned as:
RW = {w1 , w2 , ..., wp }

(8)

where each window wk considers one or more boundaries dj from RG with a
window separation limit equal to RWl .
wk = {dj , dj+1 , dj+2 , ...}
3.3

(9)

W iSeBE

WiSeBE is a normalized score dependent of (1) the performance of CT over RW
and (2) the agreement between all references in R. It is deﬁned as:
W iSeBE = F 1RW × RGAR

W iSeBE = [0, 1]

(10)

where F 1RW corresponds to the harmonic mean of precision and recall of CT
with respect to RW (Eq. 11), while RGAR is the agreement ratio deﬁned in (5).
RGAR can be interpreted as a scaling factor; a low value will penalize the overall
WiSeBE score given the low agreement between references. By contrast, for a
high agreement in R (RGAR ≈ 1), W iSeBE ≈ F 1RW .

Evaluating with W iSeBE

To exemplify the W iSeBE score we evaluated and compared the performance
of two diﬀerent SBD systems over a set of YouTube videos in a multi-reference
environment. The ﬁrst system (S1) employs a Convolutional Neural Network to
determine if the middle word of a sliding window corresponds to a SU boundary or not [6]. The second approach (S2) by contrast, introduces a bidirectional
Recurrent Neural Network model with attention mechanism for boundary detection [28].
In a ﬁrst glance we performed the evaluation of the systems against each
one of the references independently. Then, we implemented a multi-reference
evaluation with W iSeBE.
4.1

Dataset

We focused evaluation over a small but diversiﬁed dataset composed by 10
YouTube videos in the English language in the news context. The selected videos
cover diﬀerent topics like technology, human rights, terrorism and politics with
a length variation between 2 and 10 min. To encourage the diversity of content
format we included newscasts, interviews, reports and round tables.
During the transcription phase we opted for a manual transcription process
because we observed that using transcripts from an ASR system will diﬃcult
in a large degree the manual segmentation process. The number of words per
transcript oscilate between 271 and 1,602 with a total number of 8,080.
We gave clear instructions to three evaluators (ref1 , ref2 , ref3 ) of how segmentation was needed to be perform, including the SU concept and how punctuation marks were going to be taken into account. Periods (.), question marks (?),
exclamation marks (!) and semicolons (;) were considered SU delimiters (boundaries) while colons (:) and commas (,) were considered as internal SU marks.
The number of segments per transcript and reference can be seen in Table 2. An
interesting remark is that ref3 assigns about 43% less boundaries than the mean
of the other two references.

Evaluation

We ran both systems (S1 & S2) over the manually transcribed videos obtaining
the number of boundaries shown in Table 3. In general, it can be seen that S1
predicts 27% more segments than S2. This diﬀerence can aﬀect the performance
of S1, increasing its probabilities of false positives.

Table 4 condenses the performance of both systems evaluated against each
one of the references independently. If we focus on F1 scores, performance of both
systems varies depending of the reference. For ref1 , S1 was better in 5 occasions
with respect of S2; S1 was better in 2 occasions only for ref2 ; S1 overperformed
S2 in 3 occasions concerning ref3 and in 4 occasions for mean (bold).
Also from Table 4 we can observe that ref1 has a bigger similarity to S1 in
5 occasions compared to other two references, while ref2 is more similar to S2
in 7 transcripts (underline).
After computing the mean F1 scores over the transcripts, it can be concluded
that in average S2 had a better performance segmenting the dataset compared
to S1, obtaining a F1 score equal to 0.510. But... What about the complexity of
the dataset? Regardless all references have been considered, nor agreement or
disagreement between them has been taken into account.
All values related to the W iSeBE score are displayed in Table 5. The Agreement Ratio (RGAR ) between references oscillates between 0.525 for v8 and 0.767
for v5 . The lower the RGAR , the bigger the penalization W iSeBE will give to
the ﬁnal score. A good example is S2 for transcript v4 where F 1RW reaches a
value of 0.800, but after considering RGAR the W iSeBE score falls to 0.462.
It is feasible to think that if all references are taken into account at the same
time during evaluation (F 1RW ), the score will be bigger compared to an average
of independent evaluations (F 1mean ); however this is not always true. That is
the case of S1 in v10, which present a slight decrease for F 1RW compared to
F 1mean .

overperforms S1; this is inverted once the systems are evaluated with W iSeBE.

Discussion
RG A R and Fleiss’ Kappa correlation

In Sect. 3 we described the W iSeBE score and how it relies on the RGAR value
to scale the performance of CT over RW . RGAR can intuitively be consider an
agreement value over all elements of R. To test this hypothesis, we computed
the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient (P CC) [21] between RGAR and the Fleiss’
Kappa [4] of each video in the dataset (κR ).
A linear correlation between RGAR and κR can be observed in Table 6. This
is conﬁrmed by a P CC value equal to 0.890, which means a very strong positive
linear correlation between them.

F 1m ean vs. W iSeBE

Results form Table 5 may give an idea that W iSeBE is just an scaled F 1mean .
While it is true that they show a linear correlation, W iSeBE may produce a

diﬀerent system ranking than F 1mean given the integral multi-reference principle
it follows. However, what we consider the most proﬁtable about W iSeBE is the
twofold inclusion of all available references it performs. First, the construction of
RW to provide a more inclusive reference against to whom be evaluated and then,
the computation of RGAR , which scales the result depending of the agreement
between references.

Conclusions

In this paper we presented WiSeBE, a semi-automatic multi-reference sentence
boundary evaluation protocol based on the necessity of having a more reliable
way for evaluating the SBD task. We showed how W iSeBE is an inclusive metric
which not only evaluates the performance of a system against all references, but
also takes into account the agreement between them. According to your point
of view, this inclusivity is very important given the diﬃculties that are present
when working with spoken language and the possible disagreements that a task
like SBD could provoke.
W iSeBE shows to be correlated with standard SBD metrics, however we
want to measure its correlation with extrinsic evaluations techniques like automatic summarization and machine translation.
