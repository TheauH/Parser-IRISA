    <abstract>Abstract— Unsupervise learned word embeddings have seen
tremendous success in numerous Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks in recent years. The main contribution of this
paper is to develop a technique called Skill2vec, which applies
machine learning techniques in recruitment to enhance the
search strategy to find candidates possessing the appropriate
skills. Skill2vec is a neural network architecture inspired by
Word2vec, developed by Mikolov et al. in 2013. It transforms
skills to new vector space, which has the characteristics of
calculation and presents skills relationships. We conducted an
experiment evaluation manually by a recruitment company’s
domain experts to demonstrate the effectiveness of our ap-
proach.</abstract>
    <introduction>I. INTRODUCTION
Recruiters in information technology domain have met the
problem finding appropriate candidates by their skills. In the
resume, the candidate may describe one skill in different
ways or skills could be replaced by others. The recruiters
may not have the domain knowledge to know if one’s skills
are fit or not, so they can only find ones with matched skills.
In order to cope with the problem, one should try to
find the relatedness of skills. There are some approaches:
building a dictionary manually, ontology approach, natural
language processing methods, etc. In this study, we apply a
word embedding method Word2Vec, using skills from online
job post descriptions. We treat skills as terms, job posts as
documents and find the relatedness of these skills.</introduction>
    <conclusion>VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we developed a relationship network between
skills in recruitment domain by using the neural net inspired
by Word2vec model. We observed that it is possible to
train high quality word vectors using very simple model
architectures due to lower cost of computation. Moreover,
it is possible to compute very accurate high dimensional
word vectors from a much larger dataset. Using Skip-gram
architecture and an advanced technique for preprocessing
data, the result seems to be impressive. The result of our
work can contribute to building the matching system between
candidates and job post. In the other hand, candidates can
find the gap between the job post requirements and their
ability, so they can find the suitable trainings.
A direction we can follow in the future: adding domain
in training model, for example: Between Python, Java, and
R, in Data Science domain, Python and R are more relevant
than Java, however in Back End domain, Python and Java
are more relevant than R.</conclusion>
